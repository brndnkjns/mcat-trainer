        "D": "Sir Charles Sherrington"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Creating knockouts to study gene function is similar to ablation, or extirpation, in which specific parts of an organism\u2019s anatomy are removed. This approach was used by Pierre Flourens to show that specific parts of the brain served particular functions, supporting (B) as the correct answer. Unlike Pierre, Paul Broca, choice (A), did not ablate regions of the brain; rather he studied the functional impairments in individuals with different brain lesions.",
      "short_reason": "Flourens FLOURISHED by REMOVING parts - ablation removes to study function, just like gene knockouts. Think: 'Flourens Flicked it off!'",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Broca studied existing brain lesions in patients, he didn't remove brain parts himself - he observed what was already damaged.",
        "C": "Gall promoted phrenology (skull bumps = personality) - he didn't remove anything, just felt skulls.",

        "C": "Interneuron",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The cerebral cortex is not involved in the initial reflexive response to pain. Instead, the sensory receptors send information to the interneurons in the spinal cord, which stimulate a motor neuron to allow quick withdrawal. While the brain does ultimately get the signal, the reflexive withdrawal has already occurred by that time.",
      "short_reason": "Reflexes are FAST because they skip the brain! Spinal cord handles it - by the time your cortex knows, you've already moved. Think: 'Reflex = No brain required!'",

        "A": "The spinal cord is the command center for reflexes - it's where the interneuron connects sensory to motor neurons.",
        "C": "Interneurons in the spinal cord are the crucial link that allows rapid reflex responses without brain involvement.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The hindbrain is responsible for balance and motor coordination, which would be necessary for dribbling a basketball. The midbrain, (B), manages sensorimotor reflexes that also promote survival. The forebrain, (A), is associated with emotion, memory, and higher-order cognition. The spinal cord, (D), is likely not damaged as the child can still walk.",
      "short_reason": "Can't coordinate basketball but can still walk? That's the CEREBELLUM in the hindbrain - it fine-tunes movement. Think: 'Cerebellum = Coordination Central!'",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "The forebrain handles higher cognition, emotion, and memory - not motor coordination.",
        "B": "The midbrain manages reflexes and sensory relay - it doesn't coordinate complex voluntary movements.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The temporal lobes have many functions, but motor skills are not associated with this area. The temporal lobes contain Wernicke\u2019s area, which is responsible for language comprehension, (A). The temporal lobes also function in memory and emotion, (B) and (C), because they contain the hippocampus and amygdala. Motor skills are associated with the frontal lobe (primary motor cortex), basal ganglia (smooth movements), and cerebellum (coordination).",
      "short_reason": "Temporal lobe = TIME for memories, emotions, and hearing language (Wernicke's area). Motor skills are FRONTAL lobe territory. Think: 'Temporal Tells Tales, Frontal does Footwork!'",

        "C": "Hypothalamus",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus is responsible for homeostatic and emotional functions. The cerebellum, (A), is responsible for maintaining posture and balance while the pons, (B), is above the medulla and contains sensory and motor tracts between the cortex and the medulla. The thalamus, (D), acts as a relay station for sensory information.",
      "short_reason": "HypoTHALAMUS = Homeostasis + THalamus of emotions! It's the body's thermostat AND mood regulator. Think: 'Hypo handles BOTH Home and Heart!'",

        "A": "The cerebellum is all about balance and coordination - it doesn't regulate temperature or emotions.",
        "B": "The pons is a relay station between cortex and medulla - it helps with sleep but not homeostasis broadly.",

      "short_reason": "Even in lefties, the RIGHT hemisphere handles spatial tasks like finding your car. Language stays LEFT. Think: 'Right = Spatial Sight, Left = Lingual Lift!'",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Neurulation occurs when the notochord causes differentiation of overlying ectoderm into the neural tube and neural crest cells. The neural tube ultimately becomes the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and neural crest cells migrate to other sites in the body to differentiate into a number of different tissues. Thus, only statement III is true.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "If there were increased amounts of acetylcholinesterase, more acetylcholine would be degraded, lowering acetylcholine levels in the body. Low levels of acetylcholine would result in weakness or paralysis of muscles. Pain, (B), could result if one were injured and endorphins were found in low levels. Mood swings, (C), could be a result of varying levels of serotonin. Hallucinations, (D), have been seen to result from high levels of dopamine.",
      "short_reason": "More acetylcholinESTERASE = more ACh breakdown = less ACh = WEAK muscles! It's like having too many garbage collectors for your neurotransmitters. Think: 'Esterase ERASES your strength!'",
