        "A": "positively charged compounds.",
        "B": "zwitterions.",
        "C": "negatively charged compounds.",
        "D": "hydrophobic molecules."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Most amino acids (except the acidic and basic amino acids) have two sites for protonation: the carboxylic acid and the amine. At neutral pH, the carboxylic acid will be deprotonated (–COO–) and the amine will remain protonated –NH3+. This dipolar ion is a zwitterion, so (B) is the correct answer.",
      "short_reason": "Think 'ZWITTER = TWITTER' - amino acids are always chattering with both + and - charges at neutral pH, like a social media conversation!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Only positively charged if pH is very low (below pI). At neutral pH, the carboxyl group loses its proton.",
        "C": "Only negatively charged if pH is very high (above pI). At neutral pH, the amino group stays protonated.",
        "D": "Amino acids have polar groups (NH3+ and COO-) making them hydrophilic, not hydrophobic."

        "C": "0.",
        "D": "+1."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Glutamic acid is an acidic amino acid because it has an extra carboxyl group. At neutral pH, both carboxyl groups are deprotonated and thus negatively charged. The amino group has a positive charge because it remains protonated at pH 7. Overall, therefore, glutamic acid has a net charge of –1, and (B) is correct. Notice that you do not even need to know the pI values to solve this question; as an acidic amino acid, glutamic acid must have a pI below 7.",
      "short_reason": "Glutamic acid is 'GLU-my' - it's acidic and sad (negative) with that extra -1 charge from its side chain carboxyl!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "-2 would require both side chain carboxyls deprotonated AND the amino group neutral, which doesn't happen at pH 7.",
        "C": "Zero charge would mean equal positive and negative charges - but glutamic acid has an EXTRA carboxyl group.",
        "D": "+1 would require a very acidic pH where all carboxyls are protonated."

        "D": "They are hydrophobic and found on protein surfaces."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Nonpolar groups are not capable of forming dipoles or hydrogen bonds; this makes them hydrophobic. Burying hydrophobic R groups inside proteins means they don’t have to interact with water, which is polar. This makes (C) correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect because nonpolar molecules are hydrophobic, not hydrophilic; (D) is incorrect because they are not generally found on protein surfaces.",
      "short_reason": "Nonpolar R groups are like introverts at a party - they HIDE inside proteins to avoid the water (social interaction)!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Nonpolar means hydrophobic, not hydrophilic. Water-fearing groups don't like being exposed.",

        "C": "Tertiary structure",
        "D": "Quaternary structure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The cDNA sequence is a DNA copy of the mRNA used to generate a protein. A computer program can quickly identify the amino acid that corresponds to each codon and generate a list of these amino acids. This amino acid sequence is the primary structure of the protein. These observations support (A) as the correct answer. By contrast, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures involve higher level interactions between the backbone and R groups and are increasingly difficult to predict.",
      "short_reason": "cDNA to protein = reading a recipe (PRIMARY). Predicting how the cake rises and layers form (secondary/tertiary/quaternary) is much harder!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "Secondary structure involves hydrogen bonding patterns that require complex algorithms to predict accurately.",
        "C": "Tertiary structure involves all side chain interactions - extremely difficult to predict from sequence alone.",

        "C": "6",
        "D": "27"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "There are three choices for the first amino acid, leaving two choices for the second, and one choice for the third. Multiplying those numbers gives us a total of3 × 2 × 1 = 6distinct tripeptides. (Using the one-letter codes for valine (V), alanine (A), and leucine (L), those six tripeptides are VAL, VLA, ALV, AVL, LVA, and LAV.)",
      "short_reason": "VAL tripeptide = 3 factorial = 3x2x1 = 6. Remember: VAL, VLA, AVL, ALV, LVA, LAV - like arranging 3 people in a line!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "One arrangement ignores that order matters in peptides - the N-terminus and C-terminus are different.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Entropy of both the water and the protein increase.",
        "B": "Entropy of the water increases; entropy of the protein decreases.",
        "C": "Entropy of the water decreases; entropy of the protein increases.",
        "D": "Entropy of both the water and the protein decrease."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "As the protein folds, it takes on an organized structure and thus its entropy decreases. However, the opposite trend is true for the water surrounding the protein. Prior to protein folding, hydrophobic amino acid residues are exposed and the water molecules must form structured hydration shells around these hydrophobic residues. During folding, these hydrophobic residues are generally buried in the interior of the protein so that the surrounding water molecules gain more latitude in their interactions. Thus, the entropy of the surrounding water increases, making the correct answer (B).",
      "short_reason": "Protein folding: Water gets FREE (entropy up), protein gets ORGANIZED (entropy down). Think of it as cleaning your room but liberating your water bottles!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Protein becomes more ordered during folding, so its entropy DECREASES, not increases.",
        "C": "Water entropy increases as hydration shells around hydrophobic residues are released.",
        "D": "Water entropy definitely increases - those organized water cages break apart when hydrophobic groups hide inside."

        "D": "ionic attractions between side chains."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The α-helix is held together primarily by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups and amino groups of amino acids. Disulfide bridges, (A), and hydrophobic effects, (B), are primarily involved in tertiary structures, not secondary. Even if they were charged, the side chains of amino acids are too far apart to participate in strong interactions in secondary structure.",
      "short_reason": "Alpha HELIX = H-bonds HOLD it together! H for Helix, H for Hydrogen bonds!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Disulfide bonds are covalent S-S bonds between cysteines - they stabilize tertiary structure, not alpha helices.",
        "B": "Hydrophobic effects are important for tertiary structure protein folding, not secondary structure.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "High salt concentrations and detergents can denature a protein, as can high temperatures. But moving a protein to a hypotonic environment—that is, a lower solute concentration—should not lead to denaturation.",
      "short_reason": "HypoTONIC = Less TONIC (solute) = harmless to proteins. Heat, urea, and detergents denature; dilute solutions don't!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "100 degrees C gives proteins enough energy to break non-covalent bonds - classic denaturation.",
        "B": "8M urea disrupts hydrogen bonds by competing for them - a powerful denaturant.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "An amino acid likely to be found in a transmembrane portion of an α-helix will be exposed to a hydrophobic environment, so we need an amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain. The only choice that has a hydrophobic side chain is (C), phenylalanine. The other choices are all polar or charged.",
      "short_reason": "Membrane = hydrophobic = needs PHENYlalanine (F for Fat-loving!). Charged amino acids like Glu, Lys, Asp would hate it there!",

      "explanation": "In their inactive state, the receptor tyrosine kinases are fully folded single polypeptide chains and thus have tertiary structure. When these monomers dimerize, they become a protein complex and thus have elements of quaternary structure. This change from tertiary to quaternary structure justifies (B).",

An increase in the substrate concentration, while maintaining a constant enzyme concentration, leads to a proportional increase in the rate of the reaction only initially. However, once most of the active sites are occupied, the reaction rate levels off, regardless of further increases in substrate concentration. At high concentrations of substrate, the reaction rate approaches its maximal velocity and is no longer changed by further increases in substrate concentration.",

Now, draw in the lines for all the axial substituents, alternating above and below the ring. Remember to start on the anomeric C-1 carbon, where the axial substituent points down. Now start filling in the substituents. The substituent can be in either position on the anomeric carbon, so skip that one for now.

(A) is incorrect because the reactant is an aldehyde, not the product. (B) is incorrect because a hemiketal has an –OH group, an –OR group, and two –R groups.

      "explanation": "In Andersen’s disease, glycogen is less branched than normal, thereby inducing lower solubility of glycogen. Branches reduce the interactions between adjacent chains of glycogen and encourage interactions with the aqueous environment. The smaller number of branches means that glycogen phosphorylase has fewer terminal glucose monomers on which to act, making enzyme activity slower than normal overall. Finally, without branches, the density of glucose monomers cannot be as high; therefore, the total glucose stored is lower than normal. Glycogen synthase is still functioning normally, so we would expect normal α-1,4 linkages in the glycogen of an individual with Andersen’s disease but few (if any) α-1,6 linkages.",

Importantly, the substrate of phosphofructokinase, i.e. fructose-6-phosphate, has already been once phosphorylated before reaching phosphofructokinase. Therefore, fructose-6-phosphate is already trapped in the cell before even reaching phosphofructokinase. For this reason, it cannot be said that phosphofructokinase is used to trap sugar in the cell.

Given this criterion, recall the metabolic pathway of fructose, choice (B), which is phosphorylated and then cleaved into glyceraldehyde and DHAP, both of which enter glycolysis downstream of PFK-1. Therefore the metabolism of fructose does not depend on PFK-1, and would therefore be least impacted by the inhibition of PFK-1, making (B) the correct answer.

Hormone sensitive lipase is an enzyme that cleaves fatty acids from their glycerol backbones, releasing these free fatty acids for use in energy production. HSL is directly activated by epinephrine and cortisol, so (C) and (D) can be eliminated. Regarding insulin vs. glucagon, observe that free fatty acid mobilization, and therefore HSL activity, is generally associated with low blood sugar, which is also associated with elevated glucagon levels. However, glucagon does not directly regulate the activity of HSL. Rather, HSL is activated by a drop in insulin levels. For this reason, insulin does directly regulate HSL activity, and therefore (A) can be eliminated. Only glucagon, (B), does not directly influence HSL activity. Therefore (B) is the correct answer.",

        "A": "The free energy of ATP hydrolysis is independent of pH.",
        "B": "One mole of creatine phosphate can phosphorylate two moles of ADP.",
        "C": "The free energy of hydrolysis of ATP is nearly the same as for ADP.",
        "D": "ATP yields cyclic AMP after two hydrolysis reactions."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The hydrolysis of ATP is energetically favorable because there are repulsive negative charges that are relieved when hydrolyzed, and the new compounds are stabilized by resonance. This is true of both ATP and ADP. Some of the other answer choices are tempting, though. In (A), ATP hydrolysis relies on pH because a protonated ATP molecule contains less negative charge and therefore experiences less repulsive force. For (B), the energy released by one mole of creatine phosphate upon hydrolysis is not sufficient to phosphorylate two moles of ADP according to Table 12.1; creatine phosphate donates one phosphate group to a molecule of ADP, so one mole of creatine phosphate will phosphorylate one mole of ADP. For (D), the removal of two phosphate groups from ATP yields AMP, not cyclic AMP.",
      "short_reason": "ATP and ADP have similar delta G of hydrolysis! Both have phosphate group repulsion and resonance stabilization of products!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "ATP hydrolysis IS pH-dependent - protonation affects the negative charge repulsion.",
        "B": "One creatine phosphate = one ADP phosphorylated. Not enough energy for two.",
        "D": "Two hydrolysis reactions give AMP (adenosine MONOphosphate), not cyclic AMP."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Reduction is a gain of electrons, which eliminates (B) because it is an oxidation reaction. NADPH, (C), is a product of the pentose phosphate pathway. Ubiquinone, (D), transfers electrons during the course of the electron transport chain, but is not the final electron acceptor. This title belongs to oxygen.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Short-term glucocorticoid exposure causes a release of glucose and the hydrolysis of fats from adipocytes. However, if this glucose is not used for metabolism, it causes an increase in glucose level which promotes fat storage. The net result is the release of glucose from the liver to be converted into lipids in the adipose tissue under insulin stimulation.",
