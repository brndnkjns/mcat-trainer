      "question_text": "Hyperbaric oxygen may be used as a treatment for certain types of bacterial infections. In this therapy, the patient is placed in a chamber in which the partial pressure of oxygen is significantly increased, increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the patient’s tissues. This treatment is most likely used for infections with:",

        "A": "obligate aerobic bacteria.",
        "B": "facultative anaerobic bacteria.",
        "C": "aerotolerant anaerobic bacteria.",
        "D": "obligate anaerobic bacteria."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Obligate anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen and would likely be killed by such a therapy, treating the infection. The other types of bacteria listed can all survive in the presence of oxygen, so infections involving these bacteria would likely not be treated using this therapy.",
      "short_reason": "Think 'Obligate = Obligated to die in oxygen.' These bacteria MUST have anaerobic conditions - oxygen is toxic to them, making hyperbaric oxygen therapy lethal.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Obligate aerobes REQUIRE oxygen to survive, so increasing oxygen would help them thrive, not kill them.",
        "B": "Facultative anaerobes can survive with OR without oxygen - they're flexible, so oxygen wouldn't necessarily kill them.",
        "C": "Aerotolerant anaerobes can tolerate oxygen even though they don't use it - the name says 'tolerant,' so they'd survive."

        "A": "They account for most cells in muscles, bones, and tendons.",
        "B": "They secrete substances to form the extracellular matrix.",
        "C": "In organs, they tend to form the stroma.",
        "D": "In organs, they provide support for epithelial cells."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "While bones and tendons are composed predominantly of connective tissue cells, muscle tissue is considered a different tissue type. Other examples of connective tissue include cartilage, ligaments, adipose tissue, and blood. Connective tissue often secretes substances to form the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and elastin, eliminating (B). (C) and (D) are essentially identical and can both be eliminated: in organs, connective tissue often forms the support structure for epithelial cells, called the stroma.",
      "short_reason": "Remember: Muscle is its own tissue type (M for Muscle, M for Myocytes). Muscles contain muscle cells, not connective tissue cells as their primary component.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "Connective tissue cells DO secrete ECM components like collagen and elastin - this is actually their defining characteristic.",
        "C": "The stroma (supportive framework) of organs IS formed by connective tissue - 'stroma' means 'bed' or 'support.'",

      "explanation": "In a virus, the nucleic acid can be either DNA or RNA and—in both cases—can be either single- or double-stranded. Therefore, all of the types of nucleic acids listed here could be used for a viral genome, making (D) the correct answer.",
      "short_reason": "Viruses are genetic rebels - they can use ANY nucleic acid configuration. Remember 'Viruses break all the rules' - ssRNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, or dsDNA all work.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Too restrictive - while ssRNA viruses exist (like influenza), this ignores DNA viruses entirely.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The process of sterilization kills all living cells. A lack of cellular growth in these conditions supports the idea that cells can only arise from preexisting cells, matching (C). By contrast, since this experiment did not directly visualize the cells, nor did it analyze the genetic material, (A), (B), and (D) can be eliminated.",
      "short_reason": "Pasteur's experiment showed NO life from sterile media = cells can't appear from nothing. Cells must come from pre-existing cells (omnis cellula e cellula).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from an anaerobic prokaryote engulfing an aerobic prokaryote and establishing a symbiotic relationship; therefore, mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA, is likely to be similar to bacterial DNA. Both mDNA and bacterial DNA are organized into a single circular chromosome of double-stranded DNA that can replicate during binary fission. Therefore, Statements I and II are correct, while Statement III is incorrect.",
      "short_reason": "Think of mitochondria as 'captured bacteria' - they have circular, double-stranded DNA that replicates independently, just like their bacterial ancestors.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "mtDNA is BOTH circular AND self-replicating. Statement I alone is incomplete - Statement II is also true.",
        "B": "mtDNA is BOTH circular AND self-replicating. Statement II alone is incomplete - Statement I is also true.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the transport of materials throughout the cell, in lipid synthesis, and in the detoxification of drugs and poisons. Proteins from the rough ER can cross into the smooth ER, where they are secreted into cytoplasmic vesicles and transported to the Golgi apparatus. However, protein synthesis is not a function of the smooth ER, but rather of the free ribosomes or the ribosomes associated with the rough ER. (C) is therefore the correct answer.",
      "short_reason": "Smooth ER = 'Smooth' has no bumps (ribosomes). No ribosomes = no protein synthesis. Remember: RER is 'Rough' because ribosomes make it bumpy.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Lipid synthesis IS a major function of smooth ER - think of liver cells making cholesterol.",
        "B": "Detoxification IS a smooth ER function - liver smooth ER processes drugs and alcohol.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The nucleolus (not to be confused with the nucleus ) is a dense structure within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized. (A) is therefore the correct answer.",
      "short_reason": "NucleoLUS makes fRibosomaL RNA - remember 'LUS' sounds like 'loose' RNA being made. The nucleolus is the ribosome factory inside the nucleus.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "DNA replication occurs throughout the nucleus during S phase, not specifically in the nucleolus.",
        "C": "Cell division is coordinated by centrosomes and spindle apparatus, not the nucleolus.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Lysosomes are vesicular organelles that digest material using hydrolytic enzymes. They are surrounded by a single membrane. Both mitochondria and nuclei are surrounded by double membranes, eliminating (B) and (C). Ribosomes must not be surrounded by membranes because they are found not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes, which lack any membrane-bound organelles. This eliminates (D).",
      "short_reason": "Lysosomes are 'single-wrapped' bags of digestive enzymes. Mitochondria and nuclei have DOUBLE membranes. Ribosomes have NO membrane at all!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "Mitochondria have a DOUBLE membrane (outer and inner with cristae) - that's where the ETC happens.",
        "C": "Nuclei are surrounded by a DOUBLE membrane called the nuclear envelope.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Some of the main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are that prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, while eukaryotes do, eliminating (B); prokaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 30S and 50S, while eukaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 40S and 60S, eliminating (A); and prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles, whereas eukaryotes do, eliminating (D). The presence of a membrane on the outer surface of the cell could not distinguish a prokaryotic cell from a eukaryotic one because both gram-negative bacteria and animal cells share this feature. Thus, (C) is the correct answer.",
      "short_reason": "BOTH prokaryotes and eukaryotes have cell membranes! Remember: Pro/Eu differences are nucleus, membrane-bound organelles, and ribosome size (70S vs 80S).",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "Ribosomal subunit weight IS different - prokaryotes have 30S+50S (70S), eukaryotes have 40S+60S (80S).",
        "B": "Presence of a nucleus IS a difference - eukaryotes have one, prokaryotes don't (that's what 'eu-karyon' means!).",

Centrioles organize microtubules into the mitotic spindle, eliminating (D). Microfilaments are not composed of tubulin, but rather actin, making (C) the correct answer.",
      "short_reason": "Microfilaments = ACTIN (thin). Microtubules = TUBULIN (thick). Remember: 'Micro-FILA-ments' - FILA sounds like 'thin fiber' = actin.",

        "D": "The herpes simplex virus contains a tail sheath and tail fibers."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Viruses can exist in either the lytic or lysogenic cycle; they may even switch between them. During the lytic cycle, the virus’s DNA takes control of the host cell’s genetic machinery, manufacturing numerous progeny. In the end, the host cell bursts (lyses) and releases new virions, each capable of infecting other cells. In the lysogenic cycle, viral DNA is added to the host cell’s genome, where it can remain dormant for days or years. Either spontaneously or as a result of environmental circumstances, the provirus can reactivate and enter a lytic cycle. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect because the terms are reversed. (D) describes features of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria—not the human nervous system. (C) accurately describes how HSV operates during the lysogenic cycle, making it the correct answer.",

        "A": "During dormancy, the virus is in the LYSOGENIC cycle (hiding in host DNA), not lytic.",
        "B": "During an outbreak, the virus is in the LYTIC cycle (actively replicating and bursting cells), not lysogenic.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, an asexual process in which the progeny is identical to the parent. Therefore, binary fission (Statement I) does not increase genetic variability. Conjugation can be described as sexual mating in bacteria; it is the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria that are temporarily joined. Transduction occurs when fragments of the bacterial chromosome accidentally become packaged into viral progeny produced during a viral infection and are introduced into another bacterium by the viral vector. Therefore, both conjugation and transduction (Statements II and III) increase bacterial genetic variability.",

This influx of calcium triggers fusion of the synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters with the membrane of the neuron at the nerve terminal. This allows for exocytosis of the neurotransmitters into the synapse. If a disease blocked the influx of calcium, there would be no release of neurotransmitters. A lack of neurotransmitters means that the neuron cannot send excitatory signals.

      "explanation": "Inflammation of the thyroid or iodine deficiency can cause hypothyroidism, in which the thyroid hormones are undersecreted or not secreted at all. Hypothyroidism in newborn infants causes cretinism, which is characterized by poor neurological and physical development (including intellectual disabilities, short stature, and coarse facial features). While iodine deficiency can result in a swelling of the thyroid gland (called a goiter), which can also be seen in causes of hyperthyroidism, iodine deficiency does not cause hyperthyroidism, eliminating (D). Galactorrhea, (A), is associated with prolactin; gigantism, (C), is associated with growth hormone.",

Overproduction of TRH would promote overproduction of TSH, eliminating (B). Destruction of the follicular cells that produce T3 and T4 would remove negative feedback, allowing TSH levels to rise, eliminating (A) and (D). High levels of T4 would cause too much negative feedback and lower TSH levels, making (C) the correct answer.",

Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme in the lungs; angiotensin II then stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone.

The osmotic (oncotic) pressure remains relatively constant; however, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end is greater than the hydrostatic pressure at the venous end. As a result, fluid moves out of the capillaries at the arterial end and back in at the venous end. Fluid is reabsorbed at the venous end because the osmotic pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure. Proteins should not cross the capillary wall under normal circumstances.",

(C) indicates that B-cells are activated. Pattern recognition receptors, or PRRs, in (A) recognize patterns common to certain pathogens, but do not identify the specific pathogen. Complement is an example of a blood-borne nonspecific defense against bacteria, eliminating (B). Dendritic cells traveling to the lymph nodes (D) are a part of the interaction between the innate and adaptive immune systems, but the dendritic cells themselves are nonspecific.",

      "explanation": "Active immunity refers to the production of antibodies during an immune response. Active immunity may be conferred on an individual by vaccination, such as when an individual is injected with a weakened, inactive, or modified form of a particular antigen that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. Active immunity may require weeks to build. Passive immunity, on the other hand, involves the transfer of antibodies through, for example, breast milk. Another example of passive immunity would be during pregnancy, when some maternal antibodies cross the placenta and enter fetal circulation, conferring passive immunity to the fetus. Although passive immunity is acquired immediately, it is very short lived, lasting only as long as the antibodies circulate in blood.",

      "explanation": "The kidneys function to eliminate wastes such as urea, while reabsorbing various important substances such as glucose and amino acids for reuse by the body. Generation of a solute concentration gradient from the cortex to the medulla allows a considerable amount of water to be reabsorbed. Excretion of concentrated urine serves to limit water losses from the body and helps to preserve blood volume. Thus, the primary function of the nephron is to create urine that is hypertonic to the blood, making (A) the correct answer and eliminating (B) and (D). Water should be reabsorbed from the filtrate, so urine should be hypertonic to the filtrate, eliminating (C).",

The frequency of the recessive gene is r = 100% – 30% = 70%; thus, q = 0.70. The frequency of the genotypes, according to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, are given by p2 = RR, 2pq = Rr, and q2 = rr. Therefore, the frequency of the genotypes are (0.3)2 = 0.09 = 9% RR, 2 × 0.3 × 0.7 = 0.42 = 42% Rr, and (0.7)2 = 0.49 = 49% rr.",

However, the triplet reading frame after the mutation is changed, yielding a drastically different C terminal sequence that often includes a premature stop codon. These factors together support (D) as the correct answer. Note that nonsense mutations also introduce premature stop codons. However, (C) can be eliminated since a nonsense mutation will create a stop codon directly and will not change the identity of the amino acids before the stop codon.",

If part of chromosome 21 was swapped with part of chromosome 4, then a gamete resulting from meiosis in this cell would result in a daughter cell with two copies of some of the DNA from 21 and no copies of some of the DNA from 4. Therefore, after fertilization, there would be partial trisomy 21 and partial monosomy 4. While a deletion or insertion could explain one of the findings, it cannot explain both, eliminating (A) and (B). An inversion should not lead to partial trisomy or partial monosomy because the DNA is simply reversed, eliminating (D).",
