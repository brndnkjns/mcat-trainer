      "question_text": "A researcher deletes a gene from an organism to determine the gene’s function. This approach is most analogous to the work of which of the following scientists?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Paul Broca",
        "B": "Pierre Flourens",
        "C": "Franz Gall",
        "D": "Sir Charles Sherrington"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Creating knockouts to study gene function is similar to ablation, or extirpation, in which specific parts of an organism’s anatomy are removed. This approach was used by Pierre Flourens to show that specific parts of the brain served particular functions, supporting (B) as the correct answer. Unlike Pierre, Paul Broca, choice (A), did not ablate regions of the brain; rather he studied the functional impairments in individuals with different brain lesions."

      "question_text": "Which component of the nervous system is NOT involved in the initial reflexive response to pain?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Spinal cord",
        "B": "Cerebral cortex",
        "C": "Interneuron",
        "D": "Motor neuron"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The cerebral cortex is not involved in the initial reflexive response to pain. Instead, the sensory receptors send information to the interneurons in the spinal cord, which stimulate a motor neuron to allow quick withdrawal. While the brain does ultimately get the signal, the reflexive withdrawal has already occurred by that time."

      "question_text": "A child has experienced nervous system damage and can no longer coordinate the movements to dribble a basketball, although the child can still walk in an uncoordinated fashion. Which region of the central nervous system was most likely affected?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Forebrain",
        "B": "Midbrain",
        "C": "Hindbrain",
        "D": "Spinal cord"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The hindbrain is responsible for balance and motor coordination, which would be necessary for dribbling a basketball. The midbrain, (B), manages sensorimotor reflexes that also promote survival. The forebrain, (A), is associated with emotion, memory, and higher-order cognition. The spinal cord, (D), is likely not damaged as the child can still walk."

        "C": "emotion.",
        "D": "motor skills."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The temporal lobes have many functions, but motor skills are not associated with this area. The temporal lobes contain Wernicke’s area, which is responsible for language comprehension, (A). The temporal lobes also function in memory and emotion, (B) and (C), because they contain the hippocampus and amygdala. Motor skills are associated with the frontal lobe (primary motor cortex), basal ganglia (smooth movements), and cerebellum (coordination)."

        "C": "Hypothalamus",
        "D": "Thalamus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus is responsible for homeostatic and emotional functions. The cerebellum, (A), is responsible for maintaining posture and balance while the pons, (B), is above the medulla and contains sensory and motor tracts between the cortex and the medulla. The thalamus, (D), acts as a relay station for sensory information."

        "B": "Learning a new language",
        "C": "Reading a book for pleasure",
        "D": "Jumping rope with friends"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The right hemisphere is usually the nondominant hemisphere, even in left-handed individuals. Sense of direction is an ability of the nondominant hemisphere. The other answer choices are all abilities attributed to the dominant hemisphere."

      "question_text": "Which of the following is/are true with regard to neurulation?\nI. The neural tube differentiates from endoderm.\nII. The neural tube becomes the peripheral nervous system.\nIII. Neural crest cells migrate from their original site.",
      "options": {
        "A": "I only",
        "B": "III only",
        "C": "II and III only",
        "D": "I, II, and III"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Neurulation occurs when the notochord causes differentiation of overlying ectoderm into the neural tube and neural crest cells. The neural tube ultimately becomes the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and neural crest cells migrate to other sites in the body to differentiate into a number of different tissues. Thus, only statement III is true."

      "question_number": 8,
      "question_text": "Which of the following neurotransmitters is NOT classified as a catecholamine?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Epinephrine",
        "B": "Norepinephrine",
        "C": "Dopamine",
        "D": "Acetylcholine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Catecholamines are the hormones produced by the adrenal glands during the fight-or-flight response, and include epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Acetylcholine is produced by cholinergic neurons and is, thus, not a catecholamine."

      "question_text": "If the amount of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, is increased, which of the following would likely be the result?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Weakness of muscle movements",
        "B": "Excessive pain or discomfort",
        "C": "Mood swings and mood instability",
        "D": "Auditory and visual hallucinations"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "If there were increased amounts of acetylcholinesterase, more acetylcholine would be degraded, lowering acetylcholine levels in the body. Low levels of acetylcholine would result in weakness or paralysis of muscles. Pain, (B), could result if one were injured and endorphins were found in low levels. Mood swings, (C), could be a result of varying levels of serotonin. Hallucinations, (D), have been seen to result from high levels of dopamine."

      "question_text": "The adrenal glands do all of the following EXCEPT:",
      "options": {
        "A": "promote the fight-or-flight response via estrogen.",
        "B": "produce stress responses via cortisol.",
        "C": "produce both hormones and neurotransmitters.",
        "D": "release estrogen in males and testosterone in females."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The adrenal glands do promote the fight-or-flight response, but through epinephrine and norepinephrine, not estrogen. The adrenal cortex produces both estrogen and testosterone in both sexes, as mentioned in (D), thus serving as a source of estrogen in males and testosterone in females."

        "A": "High blood pressure",
        "B": "Diabetes",
        "C": "Insomnia",
        "D": "Hyperthyroidism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The pineal gland is responsible for producing melatonin, which controls the body’s circadian rhythm. Insomnia would be a disturbance of this circadian rhythm, and may be attributable to a pineal gland disorder in some cases. Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism would be unrelated to issues with the pineal gland."

        "B": "Psychological attributes could be measured by feeling the skull.",
        "C": "Specific functional impairments can be linked to specific lesions in the brain.",
        "D": "Synaptic transmission is an electrical process."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "William James studied how the mind adapts to the environment and formed the foundation of functionalism. Thus, (A) is correct. The remaining wrong answer choices can be ascribed to other scientists. Answer (B) describes phrenology, the theory of Franz Gall. Answer (C) describes the conclusions of Paul Broca. Answer (D) describes one of the conclusions of Sir Charles Sherrington (although we now know that his conclusion was false)."

        "A": "MRI",
        "B": "CT scan",
        "C": "fMRI",
        "D": "EEG"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Activity in different regions of the brain is assumed to positively correlate with blood flow. Thus, regions that are more active should have increased blood flow. Changes in blood flow can be measured via fMRI, supporting (C) as the preferred methodology. On the other hand, MRI and CT scans are used to image tissues, ruling out (A) and (B), and EEGs are useful in measuring broad brain activity and not specific brain regions, eliminating (D)."

      "question_text": "During a physical examination, a physician brushes the bottom of the foot of a patient who is fifty years old with multiple sclerosis. The patient’s toes are observed to curl toward the bottom of the foot, with no fanning of the toes. This response is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "abnormal, and evidence that the patient is exhibiting a primitive reflex.",
        "B": "normal, and evidence that the patient is exhibiting a primitive reflex.",
        "C": "abnormal, and evidence that the patient is not exhibiting a primitive reflex.",
        "D": "normal, and evidence that the patient is not exhibiting a primitive reflex."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Babinski reflex is a primitive reflex that refers to an extension of the big toe accompanied by fanning of the other toes. It is normal in infants, but should disappear with time—certainly by the time a child begins to walk. In a person who is fifty years old, the Babinski reflex would be abnormal. However, despite having a neurological illness, this patient is exhibiting a normal response to the brushing of the foot; that is, the patient is not showing the Babinski reflex."

        "C": "Scribbling with a crayon",
        "D": "Moving a toy from one hand to the other"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Motor skills tend to develop from the core toward the periphery. Following objects with the eyes occurs around four weeks of age. The other actions all require movements of the hand, which do not occur in an organized fashion until later."

        "D": "225 and 275 pounds."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Weber’s law posits that thresholds are proportional. Going from 100 to 125 pounds is a 25 percent increase. (C) is a 40 percent increase while all the rest are all under 25 percent."

        "C": "vestibular sense.",
        "D": "signal detection."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The person is discerning a specific noise within a field of many noises. This is the definition of signal detection. In an experimental setup, the person’s response would be considered a hit if the friend was indeed laughing; it would be considered a false alarm if the friend was not laughing."

        "C": "a difference threshold.",
        "D": "pain perception."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The spicy food can be considered an extreme stimulus because it eclipses what the person believes can be handled in terms of heat. However, after experiencing the stimulus over and over, the experience of spice drops to barely perceptible. This is sensory adaptation: a reduction in response to a stimulus over time."

The sensors for proprioception are found predominantly in the muscles and joints. Loss of vestibular sense, (A), would also cause difficulty walking, but this would be due to a sense of dizziness or vertigo, not an inability to feel one’s feet."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cognitive theorists proposed in the cognitive process dream theory that wakeful and dreaming states use the same mental systems within the brain, particularly stream-of-consciousness. The activation–synthesis theory, (A), states that dreams are caused by widespread, random activation of neural circuitry. The problem solving dream model, (B), indicates that dreams are used to solve problems while sleeping due to untethering of dreams from obstacles perceived while awake. The neurocognitive theorists, (D), seek to unify cognitive and biological perspectives by correlating the subjective dream experience with the physiological experience of dreaming."

Nativist theory, (A), posits a critical period during which language acquisition occurs. Social interactionist theory, (C), indicates that language develops via interaction with parents and caregivers as well as a desire of the child to communicate.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "With selective attention, a person focuses on a specific task while filtering out background stimuli. In this way, the individual in the airport ignored most of the background noise while working on a puzzle. However, the brain can shift attention quickly when a stimulus is particularly important, such as the specific call for boarding the flight. This shift is known as the cocktail party phenomenon, named for a person’s ability to quickly reorient their focus when they hear their name at a party. Thus, (A) is the correct answer. By contrast, while effortful processing, (D), describes this person’s intense focus on the puzzle, it does not explain the ability to respond quickly to the boarding announcement. Similarly, divided attention, (B), works best on simple tasks and the question stem uses the word “challenging” to describe the puzzle."

      "explanation": "The basic model of emotion, as proposed by Charles Darwin, states that emotions serve an evolutionary purpose and thus are similar across cultures. The seven universal emotions have also been used as support for this theory. The social construction model states that emotions are always a product of the current social situation and does not posit any biological basis for emotions, implying a lack of a role for emotions in evolution."
