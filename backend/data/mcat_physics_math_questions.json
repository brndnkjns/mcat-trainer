      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Using the Pythagorean theorem, calculate the magnitude of the person\u2019s displacement: x=302+402=50 m The total distance traveled is equal to 30 + 40 = 70 m. Therefore, the difference between these two is 20 m.",
      "short_reason": "Remember: Distance is PATH (30+40=70m), Displacement is DIRECT (use Pythagorean: 3-4-5 triangle scaled by 10 = 50m). Difference = 70-50 = 20m.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "0 m is wrong because distance and displacement are only equal when moving in a straight line - this path has a turn.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The average force on the rocket equals its mass times the average acceleration; the average acceleration equals the change in velocity divided by the time over which the change occurs. So, the change in velocity equals the average force times the time divided by the mass: F=ma\u2192a=Fma=\u0394v\u0394t\u2192\u0394v=a\u0394t=F\u0394tm=(20\u00d7103 N)(8 s)1000 kg=160 ms (B) represents the new velocity of the rocket, not its change in velocity. (C) and (D) neglect dividing by the mass of the rocket.",
      "short_reason": "Use Impulse-Momentum: Delta-v = F*t/m. Think 'FIT over M' - Force times time, divided by mass. (20,000 N)(8 s)/(1000 kg) = 160 m/s.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "260 m/s incorrectly adds the change in velocity (160) to the initial velocity (100) - the question asks for change only.",

      "explanation": "The magnitude of the average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time. The velocity changes by \u221240 kmhr because the car comes to rest. The time, in hours, is 6 s\u00d7[1 hr3600 s]=1600 hr. The average acceleration is then a\u00af=\u0394v\u0394t=\u221240 kmhr1600 hr=\u221224,000 kmhr2 This question asked for the magnitude of this acceleration, which is 24,000 kmhr2.",
      "short_reason": "Unit conversion trap! Convert 6 seconds to hours (6/3600 = 1/600 hr). Then a = Delta-v/Delta-t = 40/(1/600) = 24,000 km/hr^2.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "240 km/hr^2 likely comes from a unit conversion error - possibly dividing by 6 directly without converting to hours.",

      "question_text": "An elevator is designed to carry a maximum weight of 9800 N (including its own weight), and to move upward at a speed of 5 ms after an initial period of acceleration. What is the relationship between the maximum tension in the elevator cable and the maximum weight of the elevator while the elevator is accelerating upward?",

        "D": "It cannot be determined from the information given."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The forces on the elevator are the tension upward and the weight downward, so the net force on the elevator is the difference between the two. For the elevator to accelerate upwards, the tension in the cable will have to be greater than the maximum weight so that there is a net force directed upwards.",
      "short_reason": "To accelerate UP, net force must be UP. Since weight pulls DOWN, tension must EXCEED weight. Think: 'Accelerate up = Tension wins the tug-of-war.'",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "If tension were less than weight, the net force would be downward, causing downward acceleration, not upward.",
        "C": "Equal tension and weight means zero net force - the elevator would move at constant velocity, not accelerate.",
        "D": "This CAN be determined - Newton's 2nd law clearly shows tension must exceed weight for upward acceleration."

      "explanation": "The unit of power is the Watt, which breaks down to kg\u2219m2/s2. Because there is no unit of temperature in this formulation, the ambient temperature is extra information, supporting (C) as the correct answer. Note that mass, distance, and time are all used to compute power, eliminating (A), (B), and (D).",
      "short_reason": "Power = Work/Time = (Force x Distance)/Time = (mg x h)/t. Temperature (K for Kelvin) has no place in Power (W = kg*m^2/s^3).",

        "A": "Mass IS needed - it determines the force (weight = mg) required to lift the object.",

        "D": "Right before the firefighter lands on the ground"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The firefighter\u2019s acceleration is always directed downward, whereas the firefighter\u2019s velocity starts out horizontal and gradually rotates downwards as the downward velocity increases. Therefore, as time progresses, the angle between the velocity and acceleration decreases, which means that the maximum angle occurs at the instant the firefighter jumps.",
      "short_reason": "At jump: velocity is horizontal, acceleration is vertical = 90 degrees apart. As falling continues, velocity tilts downward toward acceleration. MAX angle at START!",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "At terminal velocity, velocity and acceleration are parallel (both downward) - angle is 0 degrees, not maximum.",
        "C": "Halfway through is arbitrary and the angle is already decreasing from the initial maximum.",
        "D": "Right before landing, velocity is nearly vertical (aligned with acceleration) - angle approaches 0."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The static force of friction acts parallel to the plane and is in the opposite direction from the parallel component of gravity in this setup. Because the wagon is in equilibrium, these two forces are equal in magnitude. Remember that gravity is often split into components in inclined plane problems. Rather than splitting into x- and y-components, however, it is more convenient to split the gravity vector into parallel and perpendicular components. The parallel component of gravity is given by the expression mg sin \u03b8. Plugging in the values from the question, both the parallel component of gravity and static force of friction must be equal to (10 kg)(9.8ms2) (sin 30\u00b0) = 49 N.",
      "short_reason": "Inclined plane: parallel force = mg*sin(theta). Remember 'SINE slides down.' F = (10)(10)(0.5) = 50N, closest to 49N with g=9.8.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "10 N is far too small - this might come from confusing components or forgetting multiplication.",
        "C": "85 N uses cosine instead of sine - cosine gives the perpendicular/normal component.",

When the oil separates from the water, the final state is just as ordered as the initial state (because the oil and the water are still completely separate), so the entropy change is zero. You can also answer this question by noticing the reversibility of the two experiments. Experiment A has a positive entropy change because it is irreversible, while experiment B has no entropy change because the reaction is reversible.

The object\u2019s weight is 833 N, and the buoyant force can be found using Archimedes\u2019 principle. The magnitude of the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the seawater that the anchor displaces: Fbuoy = \u03c1wVwg Because the anchor is submerged entirely, the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the anchor, which is equal to its mass divided by its density (VA=mA\u03c1A). We are not given the anchor\u2019s mass, but its value must be the magnitude of the weight of the anchor divided by g. Putting all of this together, we can obtain the buoyant force: Fbuoy=\u03c1wVwg=\u03c1wVAg=\u03c1w(mA\u03c1A)g=\u03c1w(Fg\u03c1Ag)g=Fg(\u03c1w\u03c1A)=833 N(1025 kgm37800 kgm3)\u2248100 N(actual=109 N) Lastly, we can obtain the tension from the initial equation T = Fg \u2013 Fbuoy: T = 833 N \u2212 109 N = 724 N The key to quickly solving this problem on Test Day is recognizing that the answer choices contain an outlier (A), a value slightly less than the weight of the anchor (B), the weight of the anchor (C), and a value slightly higher than the weight of the anchor (D).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The volume of blood entering and exiting the heart is always equal in a single cardiac cycle, supporting (C) as the correct answer. By contrast, the flow rate of blood through the circulatory system is not constant, as some fluids exit the circulation in tissue and is later returned via the lymphatic system, eliminating (A). Furthermore, the contraction of the heart pushing blood through arterial circulation creates an uneven flow rate which can be observed as the pulse, eliminating (B). Finally, as the diameter of the vessels decreases, resistance increases, and therefore arteries have significantly less resistance to blood flow compared to arterioles, eliminating (D).",
      "short_reason": "Heart pumps blood in pulses (systole/diastole) - flow rate varies. But total volume in = total volume out per cycle (conservation of mass). Cardiac output!",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Often, with potential energy, it can be easier to think in terms of common sense, rather than in terms of rigorous mathematical formulas: opposite charges attract. When oppositely charged species like ATP and a cation are moved apart, their potential energy will increase, reflecting the fact that these oppositely charged species would like to move back to a closer distance. Furthermore, the formula for electric potential energy is U = kQq/r. From this formula, observe that the relationship between U and r is given by U \u221d 1/r, meaning that if r is changed by a factor of 2, then U will also change by a factor of 2, and not by a factor of 4. These observations together are enough to justify (A) as the correct answer. For a more mathematically rigorous explanation, consider that the opposite charges of ATP and the cation will cause the output of the formula U = kQq/r to be negative. Then, when the distance between these two charges is doubled, this expression becomes U = kQq/2r, which is half as large in magnitude. However, because U is negative for oppositely charged species, a smaller negative value actually means that U has increased! (Consider: though the magnitude is smaller, a temperature of -5oC is actually warmer than a temperature of -25oC. Similarly, a U with a smaller negative magnitude actually means higher energy.) In short, doubling the radius means that the energy is also doubled when the charged species have opposite charges.",

      "explanation": "If these two glasses are perfectly identical, then the fact that the first glass shattered at 808 Hz tells us that this is very close (if not identical) to the natural (resonant) frequency of the glass. If the singer produces a frequency that is not equal (or very close) to the natural frequency, then the applied frequency will not cause the glass to resonate, and there will not be the increase in wave amplitude associated with resonating objects. Attenuation will increase with increased frequency because there is more motion over which nonconservative forces can damp the sound wave; however, even if sound level was matched to that which shattered the first glass when accounting for attenuation, the glass would still not shatter for the reasons described above, eliminating (D).",

To begin, remember that high-frequency sounds have a high pitch and low-frequency sounds have a low pitch. The pipe in this example begins as one that is open on both ends, and then one end is closed off. Our task, therefore, is to determine how the frequency of the second harmonic differs between a pipe that is open at both ends from one of equal length that is open at only one end. For a pipe of length L open at both ends, the wavelength for the second harmonic (first overtone) is equal to L: \u03bb=2Ln=2L2=L In contrast, for a pipe open at one end and closed at the other, the wavelength is equal to 4L3: Keep in mind that the first overtone for a closed pipe corresponds to the third harmonic, not the second. Thus, when the sibling covers one end of the flute, the wavelength increases. Given that the wavelength and the frequency of a sound are inversely proportional, an increase in wavelength corresponds to a decrease in frequency. Therefore, when the sibling covers one end of the flute, the sound produced by the instrument will be slightly lower in pitch than the original sound.",
      "short_reason": "Open pipe: lambda = 2L/n. Closed pipe: lambda = 4L/n (odd n only). First overtone: open uses n=2, closed uses n=3. Closed pipe has longer wavelength = lower frequency = lower pitch!",

According to Snell\u2019s law, the angle of refraction will be smaller than the incident angle (closer to the normal). When the light ray moves from crystal to chromium, it again goes from a lower index of refraction into a higher one, thus making the angle of refraction even smaller, eliminating (B).

To convert mass into energy, we are told that 1 amu can be converted into 932 MeV of energy. All we need to do now is calculate how much mass, in amu, is converted in the reaction. Because we are given the atomic mass for each of the elements in the reaction, this is simply a matter of balancing the equation: mass defect=(1.0087 amu+10.0129 amu) \u2013(7.0160 amu+4.0026 amu)=11.0216\u221211.0186=0.0030 amu Given both the small magnitude of this value and the small difference of the answer choices, it is best to not round at this point of the calculation. This is the amount of mass that has been converted into energy. To obtain energy from mass, we have to multiply by the conversion factor (1 amu = 932 MeV): E = 0.003 \u00d7 932 \u2248 0.003 \u00d7 900 = 2.7 MeV At this point we were able to round for an easier calculation that keeps us very near the correct answer choice.",

Repeated sampling or a large sample size is usually required to determine if a sample is truly skewed, eliminating choice (C). An anomalous result is challenging to interpret, and how to correct for the result may be unclear.
