      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Remember that when electrons are removed from an element, forming a cation, they will be removed from the subshell with the highest n value first. Zn0 has 30 electrons, so it would have an electron configuration of 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10. The 4s subshell has the highest principal quantum number, so it is emptied first, forming 1s22s22p63s23p64s03d10. (B) implies that electrons are pulled out of the d subshell, (C) presents the configuration of the uncharged zinc atom, and (D) shows the configuration that would exist if four electrons were removed.",
      "short_reason": "Remember: 'Highest n goes first!' When forming cations, electrons leave from the outermost shell (highest n) first - that's 4s before 3d, leaving Zn2+ with [Ar]3d10.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "B": "This incorrectly removes electrons from the 3d subshell. Electrons are removed from the highest principal quantum number (4s) first, not d orbitals.",
        "C": "This is the configuration of neutral zinc (Zn0), not the Zn2+ cation. Two electrons must be removed.",
        "D": "This shows removal of 4 electrons total - two from 4s and two from 3d. Zn2+ only loses 2 electrons (from 4s)."

      "explanation": "The azimuthal quantum number l cannot be higher than n \u2013 1, ruling out (A). The ml number, which describes the chemical\u2019s magnetic properties, can only be an integer value between \u2013l and l.

Recall from the chapter that a diamagnetic substance is identified by the lack of unpaired electrons in its shell. A substance without unpaired electrons, like helium, cannot be magnetized by an external magnetic field and is actually slightly repelled. Elements that come at the end of a block (Group IIA, the group containing Zn, and the noble gases, most notably) have only paired electrons.",

This question asks for the energy of one mole of photons, so we must multiply by Avogadro\u2019s number, NA = 6.02 \u00d7 1023 mol\u22121. The setup is: As we rounded during calculation, we must find the answer choice that most closely matches this value. (D) is the closest match.",

Carbon is most likely to have a mass number of 12, for six protons and six neutrons, as in (B). (C) and (D) are possible isotopes that would have more neutrons than 12C. The 6C isotope is unlikely.

      "explanation": "The MCAT covers the topics in this chapter qualitatively more often than quantitatively. It is critical to be able to distinguish the fundamental principles that determine electron organization, which are usually known by the names of the scientists who discovered or postulated them. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, (B), refers to the inability to know the momentum and position of a single electron simultaneously. The Bohr model, (C), was an early attempt to describe the behavior of the single electron in a hydrogen atom. The Rutherford model, (D), described a dense, positively charged nucleus. The element shown here, phosphorus, is often used to demonstrate Hund\u2019s rule because it contains a half-filled p subshell. Hund\u2019s rule explains that electrons fill empty orbitals first before doubling up electrons in the same orbital.",

Electron affinity generally increases as one moves up and to the right on the periodic table. Based on this trend alone, one might expect that the atom fluorine, depicted in (B), would be correct. However, the correct answer is chlorine, (D), even despite the fact that chlorine is below fluorine on the periodic table. The diagrams in the answer choices help make sense of this apparent exception: Fluorine and chlorine have the same valence electron configuration and have a similar amount of effective nuclear charge. However, when an electron is added to fluorine's valence shell, that negative charge is added to the second energy shell, which is quite small in physical size, meaning that the new electron is crowded into a small energy shell with seven other electrons. As a result, energy is still released when an electron is added to fluorine, but not as much energy as might be predicted by the general trend alone. By contrast, when an additional electron is added to a chlorine atom, that new electron adds to the third energy shell, so there is less repulsion among the valence electrons, leading to a slightly greater electron affinity for chlorine. Thus, chlorine, (D), has the highest electron affinity and is the right answer.",

In (A) and (B), chlorine has 17 protons and 10 non-valence electrons, giving it a Zeff of 7. Next, elemental potassium, (C), has the lowest effective nuclear charge because it contains additional inner shells that shield its valence electron from the nucleus.

This averages to approximately \u2212 2 3 charge on each oxygen atom, which is more negative than in the other answer choices. Both water and formaldehyde, (A) and (D), have no formal charge on the oxygen. Ozone, (C), has a \u2212 1 2 on two of the three oxygens and a +1 charge on the central oxygen.",

Alternatively, ClF3 also has three bonds; however, chloride still maintains two extra lone pairs.

The formula weight of Na2S is ( 2 \u00d7 23 g mol Na ) + ( 1 \u00d7 32 . 1 g mol S ) = 78 . 1 g mol Na 2 S . The formula weight of AgNO3 is ( 1 \u00d7 107 . 9 g mol Ag ) + ( 1 \u00d7 14 g mol N ) + ( 3 \u00d7 16 g mol O ) = 169 . 9 g mol AgNO 3 . From this, we can determine that we are given: 39 . 05 g Na 2 S 78 . 1 g mol = 0 . 5 mol Na 2 S and 85 . 5 g AgNO 3 169 . 9 g mol = 0.5 mol AgNO 3 .

Because the volume is 1 L, the amount of each gas in moles is equal to the value of the concentration of each gas in moles per liter (M). The relatively small amount of NH3 produced indicates that it will be possible to consider the amount of N2 and H2 that reacts to be negligible compared to their starting concentrations.

The cathode is always reduced in an electrochemical cell, so sodium could not be the cathode in such a galvanic cell, eliminating (A). Sodium would be the cathode in an electrolytic cell, however, which would make cadmium the anode. Thus, the answer is (B).

However, the E\u00b0cell would be \u22122.71 \u2212 (\u22120.40) = \u22122.31 V for an electrolytic cell, and +2.31 V for a galvanic cell, eliminating (C) and (D).",
