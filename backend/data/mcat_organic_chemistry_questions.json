      "explanation": "Aldehydes and carboxylic acids are characterized by their positions at the ends of carbon backbones and are thus considered terminal groups. As a result, the carbons to which they are attached are usually designated carbon 1. Ketones are internal by definition because there must be a carbon on either side of the carbonyl."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Among the functional groups presented, carboxylic acids have the highest priority, and their compounds end with an \u2013oic acid suffix. (A) denotes an alcohol, (B) a ketone, and (D) an alkyne, all of which have lower priorities than carboxylic acids. The MCAT does not test nomenclature of halides or ethers, but note that these must have lower priority than a carboxylic acid because they are less oxidized groups.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The first task in naming a compound is identifying the longest carbon chain. In this case, the longest chain has seven carbons, so the parent alkane ends in \u2013heptane. (B) and (D) can therefore be eliminated. Then, we must make sure that the carbons are numbered so that the substituents\u2019 position numbers are as small as possible. This compound has two methyl groups; minimizing their position numbers requires us to number the chain from right to left. These methyl groups are attached to carbons 2 and 5, so the correct IUPAC name is 2,5-dimethylheptane. (C) is incorrect because the position numbers of the substituents are not minimized.",

      "explanation": "We begin by finding the longest carbon chain; because there are no non-alkyl groups, we don\u2019t need to worry about any other groups\u2019 priorities. We then number our carbons such that the lowest possible combination of numbers is given to the various substituents.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Good electrophiles are positively charged or polarized. CR3+ is a tertiary carbocation; it has a positive charge, which makes it very electrophilic. CH3Cl and CH3OH are both polarized; however, the leaving groups differ between these two. Cl\u2013 is a weaker base than OH\u2013 (HCl is a stronger acid than H2O). As such, Cl\u2013 will be more stable in solution than OH\u2013, which increases the electrophilic reactivity of CH3Cl above CH3OH. CH3OCH3 has a much less stable leaving group, CH3O\u2013, and is therefore significantly less electrophilic.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Good leaving groups are weak bases, which are the conjugates of strong acids. Leaving groups must also be stable once they leave the molecule. H2O is, by far, the most stable leaving group and will be extremely unreactive once it leaves the molecule through heterolysis. Br\u2013 is the conjugate base of HBr; HO\u2013 is the conjugate base of water. HBr is a much stronger acid than water, so Br\u2013 is a better leaving group than HO\u2013. Finally, hydride (H\u2013) is a very poor leaving group because it is extremely unstable in solution."

In order from highest to lowest, this is anhydrides > carboxylic acids and esters > amides. In practical terms, this means that derivatives of higher reactivity can form derivatives of lower reactivity but not vice versa. Nucleophilic attack of an ester cannot result in the corresponding anhydride because anhydrides are more reactive than esters."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Alcohols have higher boiling points than their analogous hydrocarbons as a result of their polarized O\u2013H bonds, in which oxygen is partially negative and hydrogen is partially positive. This enables the oxygen atoms of other alcohol molecules to be attracted to the hydrogen, forming a hydrogen bond. Heat is required to overcome these hydrogen bonds, thereby increasing the boiling point. The analogous hydrocarbons do not form hydrogen bonds and, therefore, vaporize at lower temperatures. (A) is irrelevant; oxygen\u2019s bond length is not a factor in determining a substance\u2019s boiling point. (C) and (D) are true statements, but are also irrelevant to boiling point determination."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Tertiary alcohols can be oxidized only under extreme conditions because their substrate carbons do not have spare hydrogens to give up. Alcohol oxidation involves the removal of such a hydrogen so that carbon can instead make another bond to oxygen. If no hydrogen is present, a carbon\u2013carbon bond must be cleaved, which requires a great deal of energy and will, therefore, occur only under extreme conditions. (B) is incorrect because alcohols are not carbonyl-containing compounds and would more properly describe a carbonyl-containing compound that is unable to form an enolate. (C) is incorrect because the hydroxyl group of the tertiary carbon is still polarized. (D) is a false statement; tertiary alcohols are still involved in other reactions, such as SN1 reactions."

This thermodynamic stability stems from the fact that the oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon, and the keto tautomer puts more electron density around the oxygen than the enol tautomer. If the enol tautomer is less thermodynamically stable, it is also higher energy than the keto tautomer."

After the aldol is formed using strong base, the reaction may be halted by the addition of acid. Butanal in strong acid, described in (C), would be likely to deprotonate without gaining the hydroxyl group.

In an aldol condensation, (A), we would expect to form a single product by combining two aldehydes, two ketones, or one of each. A dehydration reaction, (C), should release a water molecule, rather than breaking apart a large organic molecule into two smaller molecules. A nucleophilic attack, (D), should feature the formation of a bond between a nucleophile and an electrophile; again, we would not expect to break apart a large organic molecule into two smaller molecules.

In both alcohols and carboxylic acids, the major form of intermolecular attraction is hydrogen bonding. However, hydrogen bonding is much stronger in carboxylic acids as compared to alcohols because carboxylic acids are more polar, and the carbonyl also contributes to hydrogen bonding in addition to the hydroxyl group. The stronger hydrogen bonds elevate the boiling points of carboxylic acids compared to alcohols. Boiling points also depend on molecular weight, (A), but in this case, the difference in molecular weight is insignificant compared to the effect of hydrogen bonding. (B) and (C) are both true but do not explain the difference in boiling points."

Under these conditions, the carbonyl carbon is open to attack by the nucleophilic alcohol. The rate of this reaction depends on the amount of steric hindrance around the carbonyl carbon because there must be room for the alcohol to approach the carboxylic acid substrate.

The anhydride formed from pentanedioic acid, (D), will have the five carbons in the parent chain and one oxygen atom closing the ring, meaning there are still six elements. \u03b3-butyrolactone will have five elements because it contains a bond between the ester oxygen and the third carbon away from the carbonyl carbon.

This permits delocalization of the charge through resonance. Although induction, (C), does have an effect on the stabilization of the molecule, this effect is much less significant than the impact of having a conjugated system. The electronegativity of nitrogen, (B), which primarily affects induction, is also not a vital component of the stabilization by this molecule of a positive charge because oxygen is more electronegative.

      "explanation": "In order to prepare butyl acetate from butanol, we need to perform a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction.

      "explanation": "The presence of water in an esterification reaction would likely revert some of the desired esters back into carboxylic acids. Small carboxylic acids, like formic or acetic acid, are easily dissolved in water, eliminating (A). The polarity of water plays little role in affecting the leaving group; if anything, water can be used to increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon by protonating the carbonyl oxygen\u2014eliminating (B). Finally, this is a nucleophilic substitution mechanism, not a nucleophilic addition mechanism, as mentioned in (C). Further, hydrogen bonding would likely augment the reaction."

IR spectroscopy is based on the principle that, when the molecule vibrates or rotates, there is a change in dipole moment. (A) is incorrect because oxygen does have molecular motions; they are just not detectable in IR spectroscopy.

The remaining compounds\u2014benzoic acid and naphthalene\u2014are still dissolved in ether. If the solution is extracted with an aqueous base, the benzoate anion is formed and becomes dissolved in the aqueous layer, while naphthalene, a nonpolar compound, remains in the ether. Finally, evaporation of the ether will yield purified naphthalene."

In (A) and (D), the boiling points are within 25\u00b0C of each other and would therefore require fractional distillation in order to be separated."

      "explanation": "Because this solution is composed of a much larger molecule and a much smaller molecule, size-exclusion chromatography would effectively remove the smaller insulin molecule into the fraction retained in the column and allow the titin to be eluted. Affinity chromatography, (C), could also be used, but comes with a risk of rendering the titin unusable; the eluent run through an affinity chromatography column often binds to the target molecule."
