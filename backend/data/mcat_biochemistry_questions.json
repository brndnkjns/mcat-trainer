      "question_text": "In a neutral solution, most amino acids exist as:",
      "options": {
        "A": "positively charged compounds.",
        "B": "zwitterions.",
        "C": "negatively charged compounds.",
        "D": "hydrophobic molecules."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Most amino acids (except the acidic and basic amino acids) have two sites for protonation: the carboxylic acid and the amine. At neutral pH, the carboxylic acid will be deprotonated (–COO–) and the amine will remain protonated –NH3+. This dipolar ion is a zwitterion, so (B) is the correct answer."

        "C": "0.",
        "D": "+1."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Glutamic acid is an acidic amino acid because it has an extra carboxyl group. At neutral pH, both carboxyl groups are deprotonated and thus negatively charged. The amino group has a positive charge because it remains protonated at pH 7. Overall, therefore, glutamic acid has a net charge of –1, and (B) is correct. Notice that you do not even need to know the pI values to solve this question; as an acidic amino acid, glutamic acid must have a pI below 7."

      "options": {
        "A": "They are hydrophilic and found buried within proteins.",
        "B": "They are hydrophilic and found on protein surfaces.",
        "C": "They are hydrophobic and found buried within proteins.",
        "D": "They are hydrophobic and found on protein surfaces."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Nonpolar groups are not capable of forming dipoles or hydrogen bonds; this makes them hydrophobic. Burying hydrophobic R groups inside proteins means they don’t have to interact with water, which is polar. This makes (C) correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect because nonpolar molecules are hydrophobic, not hydrophilic; (D) is incorrect because they are not generally found on protein surfaces."

      "question_text": "Scientists discover a cDNA sequence for an uncharacterized protein. In their initial studies, they use a computer program designed to predict protein structure. Which of the following levels of protein structure can be most accurately predicted?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary structure",
        "B": "Secondary structure",
        "C": "Tertiary structure",
        "D": "Quaternary structure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The cDNA sequence is a DNA copy of the mRNA used to generate a protein. A computer program can quickly identify the amino acid that corresponds to each codon and generate a list of these amino acids. This amino acid sequence is the primary structure of the protein. These observations support (A) as the correct answer. By contrast, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures involve higher level interactions between the backbone and R groups and are increasingly difficult to predict."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "There are three choices for the first amino acid, leaving two choices for the second, and one choice for the third. Multiplying those numbers gives us a total of3 × 2 × 1 = 6distinct tripeptides. (Using the one-letter codes for valine (V), alanine (A), and leucine (L), those six tripeptides are VAL, VLA, ALV, AVL, LVA, and LAV.)"

      "options": {
        "A": "Entropy of both the water and the protein increase.",
        "B": "Entropy of the water increases; entropy of the protein decreases.",
        "C": "Entropy of the water decreases; entropy of the protein increases.",
        "D": "Entropy of both the water and the protein decrease."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "As the protein folds, it takes on an organized structure and thus its entropy decreases. However, the opposite trend is true for the water surrounding the protein. Prior to protein folding, hydrophobic amino acid residues are exposed and the water molecules must form structured hydration shells around these hydrophobic residues. During folding, these hydrophobic residues are generally buried in the interior of the protein so that the surrounding water molecules gain more latitude in their interactions. Thus, the entropy of the surrounding water increases, making the correct answer (B)."

        "C": "hydrogen bonds.",
        "D": "ionic attractions between side chains."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The α-helix is held together primarily by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups and amino groups of amino acids. Disulfide bridges, (A), and hydrophobic effects, (B), are primarily involved in tertiary structures, not secondary. Even if they were charged, the side chains of amino acids are too far apart to participate in strong interactions in secondary structure."

      "options": {
        "A": "Heating the protein to 100°C",

        "C": "Moving it to a more hypotonic environment",
        "D": "Adding a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "High salt concentrations and detergents can denature a protein, as can high temperatures. But moving a protein to a hypotonic environment—that is, a lower solute concentration—should not lead to denaturation."

        "C": "Phenylalanine",
        "D": "Aspartate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "An amino acid likely to be found in a transmembrane portion of an α-helix will be exposed to a hydrophobic environment, so we need an amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain. The only choice that has a hydrophobic side chain is (C), phenylalanine. The other choices are all polar or charged."

        "D": "I, II, and III"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Every amino acid except glycine has a chiral α-carbon, but only two of the 20 amino acids—threonine and isoleucine— also have a chiral carbon in their side chains as well. Thus, the correct answer is (C). Just as only one configuration is normally seen at the αcarbon, only one configuration is seen in the side chain chiral carbon."

      "question_text": "Following translation and folding, many receptor tyrosine kinases exist as monomers in their inactive state on the cell membrane. Upon the binding of a ligand, these proteins dimerize and initiate a signaling cascade. During this process, their highest element of protein structure changes from:",

        "C": "primary to secondary.",
        "D": "secondary to quaternary."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In their inactive state, the receptor tyrosine kinases are fully folded single polypeptide chains and thus have tertiary structure. When these monomers dimerize, they become a protein complex and thus have elements of quaternary structure. This change from tertiary to quaternary structure justifies (B)."

        "C": "7.4.",
        "D": "9.8."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Because lysine has a basic side chain, we ignore the pKa of the carboxyl group, and average the pKa of the side chain and the amino group; the average of 9 and 10.5 is 9.75, which is closest to (D)."

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Conjugated proteins can have lipid or carbohydrate “tags” added to them. These tags can indicate that these proteins should be directed to the cell membrane (especially lipid tags) or to specific organelles (such as the lysosome). They can also provide the activity of the protein; for example, the heme group in hemoglobin is needed for it to bind oxygen. Thus, (D) is the correct answer."

        "C": "Threonine",
        "D": "Cysteine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Because collagen has a triple helix, the carbon backbones are very close together. Thus, steric hindrance is a potential problem. To reduce that hindrance, we need small side chains; glycine has the smallest side chain of all: a hydrogen atom."

      "options": {
        "A": "The reaction will proceed until the enzyme concentration decreases.",

        "D": "The free energy change (ΔG) of the catalyzed reaction is the same as for the uncatalyzed reaction."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Enzymes catalyze reactions by lowering their activation energy, and are not changed or consumed during the course of the reaction. While the activation energy is lowered, the free energy of the reaction, ΔG, remains unchanged in the presence of an enzyme. A reaction will continue to occur in the presence or absence of an enzyme; it simply runs slower without the enzyme, eliminating (A). Most physiological reactions are optimized at body temperature, 37°C, eliminating (B). Finally, dehydrogenases catalyze oxidation–reduction reactions, not transfer reactions, eliminating (C)."

      "options": {
        "A": "An increase in the substrate concentration (at constant enzyme concentration) leads to proportional increases in the rate of the reaction.",
        "B": "Most enzymes operating in the human body work best at a temperature of 37°C.",
        "C": "An enzyme–substrate complex can either form a product or dissociate back into the enzyme and substrate.",
        "D": "Maximal activity of many human enzymes occurs around pH 7.4."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Most enzymes in the human body operate at maximal activity around a temperature of 37°C and a pH of 7.4, which is the pH of most body fluids. In addition, as characterized by the Michaelis–Menten equation, enzymes form an enzyme–substrate complex, which can either dissociate back into the enzyme and substrate or proceed to form a product. So far, we can eliminate (B), (C), and (D), so let’s check (A). An increase in the substrate concentration, while maintaining a constant enzyme concentration, leads to a proportional increase in the rate of the reaction only initially. However, once most of the active sites are occupied, the reaction rate levels off, regardless of further increases in substrate concentration. At high concentrations of substrate, the reaction rate approaches its maximal velocity and is no longer changed by further increases in substrate concentration."

      "explanation": "As the temperature of the DNA polymerase sample increases from 0°C to the usual physiological temperature, i.e. 37°C, the enzyme's activity will increase. However, at temperatures above 37°C, the enzyme's activity will rapidly decline due to denaturation."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "By limiting the activity of enzyme 1, the rest of the pathway is slowed, which is the definition of negative feedback. (A) is incorrect because there is no competition for the active site with allosteric interactions. While many products do indeed competitively inhibit an enzyme in the pathway that creates them, this is an example of an allosterically inhibited enzyme. There is not enough information for (B) to be correct because we aren’t told whether the inhibition is reversible. In general, allosteric interactions are temporary. (C) is incorrect because it is the opposite of what occurs when enzyme 1 activity is reduced."

      "explanation": "Based on the graph, when the substrate is present, oseltamivir results in the same Vmax and a higher Km compared to when no inhibitor is added.

Because the question is only comparing the values between the two inhibitors, and not the enzyme without inhibitor, the mechanism of inhibition is less important to determine than the values of Km and Vmax. This is a great example of why previewing the answer choices works well in the sciences."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cooperative enzymes demonstrate a change in affinity for the substrate depending on how many substrate molecules are bound and whether the last change was accomplished because a substrate molecule was bound or left the active site of the enzyme. Because we cannot determine whether the most recent reaction was binding or dissociation, (A) and (B) are eliminated. We can make absolute comparisons though. For enzymes expressing positive cooperativity, the unbound enzyme has the lowest affinity for substrate, and the enzyme with all but one subunit bound has the highest. The increase in affinity is not necessarily linear. Furthermore, if all four sites have substrate bound, the enzyme cannot bind to any more substrate. Therefore, (C) is not true. An enzyme with two subunits occupied must have a higher affinity for the substrate than the same enzyme with only one subunit occupied; thus, (D) is correct."

      "explanation": "The rate of reaction increases with temperature because of the increased kinetic energy of the reactants, but reaches a peak temperature because the enzyme denatures with the disruption of hydrogen bonds at excessively high temperatures. In the absence of enzyme, this peak temperature is generally much hotter. Heating a reaction provides molecules with an increased chance of achieving the activation energy, but the enzyme catalyst would typically reduce activation energy. Keep in mind that thermodynamics and kinetics are not interchangeable, so we are not considering the impact of heat on the equilibrium position."

The protein could have been inactivated by experimental conditions like detergents, heat, or pH; however, these are not answer choices. Rather, we must consider how the experimental procedure works.

      "explanation": "When glucose reacts with methanol under acid catalysis, the hemiacetal is converted to an acetal via replacement of the anomeric hydroxyl group with an alkoxy group. The result is a type of acetal known as a glycoside. This corresponds with (B). The other choices all show alkoxy groups on the wrong carbon, or too many carbons."

      "explanation": "Start by drawing out the Haworth projection. Recall that all the groups on the right in the Fischer projection will go on the bottom of the Haworth projection, and all the groups on the left will go on the top. Next, draw the chair structure, with the oxygen in the back right corner. Label the carbons in the ring 1 through 5, starting from the oxygen and moving clockwise around the ring. Now, draw in the lines for all the axial substituents, alternating above and below the ring. Remember to start on the anomeric C-1 carbon, where the axial substituent points down. Now start filling in the substituents. The substituent can be in either position on the anomeric carbon, so skip that one for now. The –OH groups on C-2 and C-4 should point downward while the –OH group on C-3 should point upward; (C), the β-anomer of D-glucose, is the only one that matches."

(A) is incorrect because the reactant is an aldehyde, not the product. (B) is incorrect because a hemiketal has an –OH group, an –OR group, and two –R groups.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In Andersen’s disease, glycogen is less branched than normal, thereby inducing lower solubility of glycogen. Branches reduce the interactions between adjacent chains of glycogen and encourage interactions with the aqueous environment. The smaller number of branches means that glycogen phosphorylase has fewer terminal glucose monomers on which to act, making enzyme activity slower than normal overall. Finally, without branches, the density of glucose monomers cannot be as high; therefore, the total glucose stored is lower than normal. Glycogen synthase is still functioning normally, so we would expect normal α-1,4 linkages in the glycogen of an individual with Andersen’s disease but few (if any) α-1,6 linkages."

When a monosaccharide is in its cyclic form, the anomeric carbon is attached to the oxygen in the ring and a hydroxyl group. Hence, it is only a hemiacetal or hemiketal because an acetal or ketal would require the –OH group to be converted to another –OR group."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Because we are looking for the false statement, we have to read each choice to eliminate those that are true or find one that is overtly false. Let’s quickly review the main differences between DNA and RNA. In cells, DNA is double-stranded, with a deoxyribose sugar and the nitrogenous bases A, T, C, and G. RNA, on the other hand, is usually single-stranded, with a ribose sugar and the bases A, U, C, and G. (D) is false because both DNA replication and RNA synthesis proceed in a 5′ to 3′ direction."

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The melting temperature of DNA is the temperature at which a DNA double helix separates into two single strands (denatures). To do this, the hydrogen bonds linking the base pairs must be broken. Cytosine binds to guanine with three hydrogen bonds, whereas adenine binds to thymine with two hydrogen bonds. The amount of heat needed to disrupt the bonding is proportional to the number of bonds. Thus, the higher the GC-content in a DNA segment, the higher the melting point."

      "explanation": "For a compound to be aromatic, it must be cyclic, planar, conjugated, and contain 4n + 2 π electrons, where n is any integer. Conjugation requires that every atom in the ring have at least one unhybridized p-orbital. While most examples of aromatic compounds have alternating single and double bonds, compounds can be aromatic if they contain triple bonds as well; this would still permit at least one unhybridized p-orbital."

      "explanation": "This question requires an understanding of osmosis and the action of the sodium–potassium pump. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution (a solution having a higher solute concentration than the cell), fluid will diffuse out of the cell and result in cell shrinkage. When a cell is placed in hypotonic solution (a solution having a lower solute concentration than the cell), fluid will diffuse from the solution into the cell, causing the cell to expand and possibly lyse. The sodium–potassium pump moves three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it lets into the cell. Therefore, inhibition of the sodium–potassium pump by ouabain will cause a net increase in the sodium concentration inside the cell and water will diffuse in, causing the cell to swell and then lyse."

Its role is to phosphorylate fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate during the third step of glycolysis. Importantly, the substrate of phosphofructokinase, i.e. fructose-6-phosphate, has already been once phosphorylated before reaching phosphofructokinase. Therefore, fructose-6-phosphate is already trapped in the cell before even reaching phosphofructokinase. For this reason, it cannot be said that phosphofructokinase is used to trap sugar in the cell. By contrast, (A), (B), and (D), can be eliminated because hexokinase phosphorylates glucose, galactokinase phosphorylates galactose, and fructokinase phosphorylates fructose, each reaction trapping the previously unphosphorylated sugar in the cell."

High levels of acetyl-CoA, which is produced during β-oxidation, will inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase and shift the citric acid cycle to run in the reverse direction, producing oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis. Acetyl-CoA also stimulates pyruvate carboxylase directly."

During glycogenolysis, it seems that the child is able to remove individual glucose monomers and process glycogen down to the branch point itself, which requires glycogen phosphorylase, (A), and α-1,4:α-1,4 transferase, (C).

      "explanation": "In most biochemical pathways, only a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl-CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). After intense exercise, one would expect PDH to be highly active to generate ATP. ADP levels, (A), should be high because ATP was just burned by the muscle. Acetyl-CoA, (B), is an inhibitor of PDH, causing a shift of pyruvate into the gluconeogenic pathway. A high NADH/NAD+ ratio, (C), would imply that the cell is already energetically satisfied and not in need of energy, which would not be expected in intensely exercising muscle."

      "explanation": "In this question, the right answer will be the molecule whose metabolism will be the least impacted by the inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). The enzyme PFK-1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glycolysis. So sugars that enter the glycolytic pathway after this rate-limiting step, i.e. downstream of PFK-1, would be least impacted by inhibition of PFK-1. Given this criterion, recall the metabolic pathway of fructose, choice (B), which is phosphorylated and then cleaved into glyceraldehyde and DHAP, both of which enter glycolysis downstream of PFK-1. Therefore the metabolism of fructose does not depend on PFK-1, and would therefore be least impacted by the inhibition of PFK-1, making (B) the correct answer. By contrast, glucose, (C), is metabolised using the usual glycolytic pathway, and would therefore be impacted by inhibition of PFK-1. Similarly, galactose, (D), is phosphorylated and subsequently isomerized into glucose-6-phosphate, which then follows the usual pathway and would therefore be impacted by inhibition of PFK-1. And lactose, (A), is cleaved by lactase into glucose and galactose. For these reasons, (A), (B), and (D) can be eliminated."

The pentose phosphate pathway is responsible for generating NADPH, which is used to reduce glutathione, one of the natural antioxidants present in the body. In individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, NADPH cannot be produced at sufficient levels, and oxidative stresses lead to cell membrane and protein (hemoglobin) damage.

      "explanation": "This question asks for the hormone that does not directly regulate the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Hormone sensitive lipase is an enzyme that cleaves fatty acids from their glycerol backbones, releasing these free fatty acids for use in energy production. HSL is directly activated by epinephrine and cortisol, so (C) and (D) can be eliminated. Regarding insulin vs. glucagon, observe that free fatty acid mobilization, and therefore HSL activity, is generally associated with low blood sugar, which is also associated with elevated glucagon levels. However, glucagon does not directly regulate the activity of HSL. Rather, HSL is activated by a drop in insulin levels. For this reason, insulin does directly regulate HSL activity, and therefore (A) can be eliminated. Only glucagon, (B), does not directly influence HSL activity. Therefore (B) is the correct answer."

In order to accomplish this in monounsaturated fatty acids, an isomerase is employed. When there are multiple double bonds that fall within the enzymatic binding site, both an isomerase and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase are required for the oxidative enzymes to act on the fatty acid. For this question, simply recognizing that dienoyl refers to having multiple double bonds is sufficient to arrive at the answer."

All of the amino acids listed in the answer choices are glucogenic; isoleucine is also ketogenic. The energy acquired from an amino acid will also depend on the number of carbons it can donate to these energy-creating processes, which depends on the size of its side chain.

This is true of both ATP and ADP. Some of the other answer choices are tempting, though. In (A), ATP hydrolysis relies on pH because a protonated ATP molecule contains less negative charge and therefore experiences less repulsive force. For (B), the energy released by one mole of creatine phosphate upon hydrolysis is not sufficient to phosphorylate two moles of ADP according to Table 12.1; creatine phosphate donates one phosphate group to a molecule of ADP, so one mole of creatine phosphate will phosphorylate one mole of ADP.

        "A": "Active skeletal muscle",
        "B": "Resting skeletal muscle",
        "C": "Cardiac muscle",
        "D": "Smooth muscle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Adipose tissue and resting skeletal muscle require insulin for glucose uptake. Active skeletal muscle, (A), uses creatine phosphate and glycogen (regulated by epinephrine and AMP) to maintain its energy requirements."

      "options": {
        "A": "they increase appetite and decrease satiety signals.",
        "B": "they increase the activity of catabolic hormones.",
        "C": "they increase glucose levels, which causes insulin secretion.",
        "D": "they interfere with activity of the leptin receptor."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Short-term glucocorticoid exposure causes a release of glucose and the hydrolysis of fats from adipocytes. However, if this glucose is not used for metabolism, it causes an increase in glucose level which promotes fat storage. The net result is the release of glucose from the liver to be converted into lipids in the adipose tissue under insulin stimulation."

        "D": "Liver"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The brain uses aerobic metabolism of glucose exclusively and therefore is very sensitive to oxygen levels. The extremely high oxygen requirement of the brain (20% of the body’s oxygen content) relative to its size (2% of total body weight) implies that brain is the most sensitive organ to oxygen deprivation."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The respiratory quotient (RQ) gives an indication of the primary fuel being utilized. An RQ around 0.7 indicates lipid metabolism, 0.8–0.9 indicates amino acid metabolism, (D), and 1.0 indicates carbohydrate metabolism, (A). Nucleic acids do not contribute significantly to the respiratory quotient."

        "C": "Irritability",
        "D": "Fever"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Leptin acts to decrease appetite by inhibiting the production of orexin. Orexin is also associated with alertness, so decreasing the level of orexin in the body is expected to cause drowsiness. Even without this information, the answer should be apparent because the body tends to maintain an energy balance. If consumption decreases, energy expenditures are expected to decrease as well."

        "D": "Enzyme phosphorylation and dephosphorylation."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A prolonged fast is characterized by an increase in glucagon, which accomplishes its cellular activity by phosphorylating and dephosphorylating metabolic enzymes. Glycogen storage, (B), is then halted, but this requires enzyme regulation by glucagon to occur. Later in the postabsorptive state, protein breakdown, (C), begins. Eventually, in starvation, ketone bodies, (A), are used by the brain for its main energy source."
