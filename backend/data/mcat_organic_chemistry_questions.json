The acidity of hexanol and cyclohexanol are close, but the hydroxyl hydrogen of hexanol is slightly more acidic because the ring structure of cyclohexanol is slightly electron-donating, which makes its hydroxyl hydrogen slightly less acidic.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Because this solution is composed of a much larger molecule and a much smaller molecule, size-exclusion chromatography would effectively remove the smaller insulin molecule into the fraction retained in the column and allow the titin to be eluted. Affinity chromatography, (C), could also be used, but comes with a risk of rendering the titin unusable; the eluent run through an affinity chromatography column often binds to the target molecule.",
      "short_reason": "SIZE-EXCLUSION separates by molecular weight! Giant titin (3816 kD) elutes first (too big for pores), tiny insulin (5.8 kD) gets trapped in pores and elutes later.",
      "wrong_answer_explanations": {
        "A": "TLC is analytical and wouldn't effectively separate proteins of such different sizes.",
        "B": "Ion-exchange separates by charge - both proteins might have similar charge properties.",
        "C": "Affinity might denature or modify the titin - size-exclusion is gentler."

      "question_text": "During gravity filtration, a student forgets to heat the solution before running it through the filter. After capturing the filtrate, the student analyzes the sample via infrared (IR) spectroscopy and finds none of the desired product in the filtrate.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Warm or hot solvent is generally used in gravity filtration to keep the desired product soluble. This allows the product to remain in the filtrate, which can then be collected. In this case, the student likely used solvent that was too cold, and the product crystallized out. The product should be present in the residue.",

        "A": "Gravity filtration is gentle - products don't degrade during filtration.",
        "B": "Evaporation during filtration would concentrate the solution, not lose product.",

      "explanation": "Because the lactoferrin proteins are likely to be charged, as is the resin described in the question, this is an example of ion-exchange chromatography. The charged protein molecules will stick to the column, while the remainder of the milk washes through and can later be washed off of the column and collected.",
