      "question_text": "Hyperbaric oxygen may be used as a treatment for certain types of bacterial infections. In this therapy, the patient is placed in a chamber in which the partial pressure of oxygen is significantly increased, increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the patient\u2019s tissues. This treatment is most likely used for infections with:",
      "options": {
        "A": "obligate aerobic bacteria.",
        "B": "facultative anaerobic bacteria.",
        "C": "aerotolerant anaerobic bacteria.",
        "D": "obligate anaerobic bacteria."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Obligate anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen and would likely be killed by such a therapy, treating the infection. The other types of bacteria listed can all survive in the presence of oxygen, so infections involving these bacteria would likely not be treated using this therapy."

        "D": "In organs, they provide support for epithelial cells."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "While bones and tendons are composed predominantly of connective tissue cells, muscle tissue is considered a different tissue type. Other examples of connective tissue include cartilage, ligaments, adipose tissue, and blood. Connective tissue often secretes substances to form the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and elastin, eliminating (B). (C) and (D) are essentially identical and can both be eliminated: in organs, connective tissue often forms the support structure for epithelial cells, called the stroma."

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The process of sterilization kills all living cells. A lack of cellular growth in these conditions supports the idea that cells can only arise from preexisting cells, matching (C). By contrast, since this experiment did not directly visualize the cells, nor did it analyze the genetic material, (A), (B), and (D) can be eliminated."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from an anaerobic prokaryote engulfing an aerobic prokaryote and establishing a symbiotic relationship; therefore, mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA, is likely to be similar to bacterial DNA. Both mDNA and bacterial DNA are organized into a single circular chromosome of double-stranded DNA that can replicate during binary fission. Therefore, Statements I and II are correct, while Statement III is incorrect."

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the transport of materials throughout the cell, in lipid synthesis, and in the detoxification of drugs and poisons. Proteins from the rough ER can cross into the smooth ER, where they are secreted into cytoplasmic vesicles and transported to the Golgi apparatus. However, protein synthesis is not a function of the smooth ER, but rather of the free ribosomes or the ribosomes associated with the rough ER. (C) is therefore the correct answer."

        "C": "Nuclei",
        "D": "Ribosomes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Lysosomes are vesicular organelles that digest material using hydrolytic enzymes. They are surrounded by a single membrane. Both mitochondria and nuclei are surrounded by double membranes, eliminating (B) and (C). Ribosomes must not be surrounded by membranes because they are found not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes, which lack any membrane-bound organelles. This eliminates (D)."

        "D": "Presence of membrane-bound organelles"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Some of the main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are that prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, while eukaryotes do, eliminating (B); prokaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 30S and 50S, while eukaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 40S and 60S, eliminating (A); and prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles, whereas eukaryotes do, eliminating (D). The presence of a membrane on the outer surface of the cell could not distinguish a prokaryotic cell from a eukaryotic one because both gram-negative bacteria and animal cells share this feature. Thus, (C) is the correct answer."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Tubulin is the primary protein in microtubules, which are responsible for the structure and movement of cilia and flagella, eliminating (A) and (B). Centrioles organize microtubules into the mitotic spindle, eliminating (D). Microfilaments are not composed of tubulin, but rather actin, making (C) the correct answer."

      "question_text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) enters the human body and remains dormant in the nervous system until it produces an outbreak after exposure to heat, radiation, or other stimuli. Which of the following statements correctly describes HSV?",
      "options": {
        "A": "While it remains dormant in the nervous system, the virus is in its lytic cycle.",
        "B": "During an outbreak, the virus is in the lysogenic cycle.",
        "C": "Herpes simplex virus adds its genetic information to the genetic information of the cell.",
        "D": "The herpes simplex virus contains a tail sheath and tail fibers."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Viruses can exist in either the lytic or lysogenic cycle; they may even switch between them. During the lytic cycle, the virus\u2019s DNA takes control of the host cell\u2019s genetic machinery, manufacturing numerous progeny. In the end, the host cell bursts (lyses) and releases new virions, each capable of infecting other cells. In the lysogenic cycle, viral DNA is added to the host cell\u2019s genome, where it can remain dormant for days or years. Either spontaneously or as a result of environmental circumstances, the provirus can reactivate and enter a lytic cycle. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect because the terms are reversed. (D) describes features of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria\u2014not the human nervous system. (C) accurately describes how HSV operates during the lysogenic cycle, making it the correct answer."

      "question_text": "Resistance to antibiotics is a well-recognized medical problem. Which mechanisms can account for a bacterium\u2019s ability to increase its genetic variability and thus adapt itself to resist different antibiotics?\nI. Binary fission\nII. Conjugation\nIII. Transduction",
      "options": {
        "A": "I and II only",
        "B": "I and III only",
        "C": "II and III only",
        "D": "I, II, and III"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, an asexual process in which the progeny is identical to the parent. Therefore, binary fission (Statement I) does not increase genetic variability. Conjugation can be described as sexual mating in bacteria; it is the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria that are temporarily joined. Transduction occurs when fragments of the bacterial chromosome accidentally become packaged into viral progeny produced during a viral infection and are introduced into another bacterium by the viral vector. Therefore, both conjugation and transduction (Statements II and III) increase bacterial genetic variability."

      "question_text": "A bacterial cell is noted to be resistant to penicillin. The bacterium is transferred to a colony that lacks the fertility factor, and the rest of the colony does not become resistant to penicillin. However, the penicillin-resistant cell has also started to exhibit other phenotypic characteristics, including secretion of a novel protein. Which of the following methods of bacterial recombination is NOT likely to account for this change?",

        "A": "Conjugation",
        "B": "Transformation",
        "C": "Transduction",
        "D": "Infection with a bacteriophage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A bacterial cell that does not rapidly cause a phenotypic change in the rest of the colony is likely not F+, meaning that this cell is not able to form a sex pilus for conjugation, making (A) correct. The expression of new phenotypic characteristics indicates that this bacterium may have acquired genetic material from the environment through transformation, (B), or transduction (which occurs via bacteriophage infection), (C) and (D)."

        "C": "Prions",
        "D": "Viroids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Prions are infectious proteins that cause misfolding of other proteins. Prions generally cause a shift toward \u03b2-pleated sheet conformations, causing decreased solubility and increased resistance to degradation. This ultimately leads to disease. This mechanism is very similar to the one described here for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, making (C) the correct answer."

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A virus that requires transport to the nucleus in order to produce viral proteins likely requires use of nuclear RNA polymerase in order to create mRNA that can be translated to protein. Therefore, only DNA viruses need to be transported to the nucleus to produce viral proteins, eliminating all answer choices but (A)."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "To ensure that the labeled deoxyadenine will be incorporated into the DNA of one of the daughter cells, we have to insert the nucleotide before DNA replication has been completed. Because replication occurs during S stage, we could introduce the deoxyadenine during G1 or S stage. Because G1 precedes S, the latest point at which the deoxyadenine could be added is the S stage."

      "explanation": "This subtle point about ovulation is missed by most students and remains hard to believe until the organs are examined in anatomy class in medical school. The ruptured ovarian follicle releases an oocyte into the abdominal cavity, close to the entrance of the fallopian tube. With the aid of beating cilia, the oocyte is drawn into the fallopian tube, through which it travels until it reaches the uterus. If it is fertilized in the fallopian tube, it will implant in the uterine wall. If fertilization does not occur, it will be expelled along with the uterine lining during menstruation."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The question is asking us to determine at which points in the cell cycle we can prevent or at least lower the number of cells undergoing mitosis. One idea would be to prevent DNA synthesis during the S stage of the cell cycle. Without the DNA being replicated, two viable daughter cells could not be formed. Other ideas would be preventing the mitotic cycle from forming altogether in prophase by preventing spindle apparatus formation, preventing the nuclear membrane from dissolving, or interfering with other processes during this phase. Similarly, a treatment that would act on cells in the metaphase stage of the cell cycle would also interfere with the mitotic cycle. Therefore, any of the three solutions presented would be a viable option."

Near the end of telophase I, cytokinesis occurs, resulting in two haploid (n) daughter cells. Thus, during interkinesis and anaphase II, the daughter cells are already haploid, eliminating (C) and (D). The cell is diploid during interphase, (A), but remains diploid up until the end of telophase I."

The random fertilization of an egg by a sperm, the random segregation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I, and crossing over between homologous chromosomes during prophase I all contribute to genetic variability during sexual reproduction because they result in novel combinations of genetic material, eliminating (A), (B), and (C). S stage, (D), should not cause increased genetic variability; the DNA should be copied precisely, without error, meaning that both strands of DNA should be identical."

These hormones are necessary for proper gestation of the fetus and should be measurable in maternal blood because they act on maternal organs. Prior to birth, the fetus is immunologically na\u00efve and does not yet produce immunoglobulins, eliminating (A). It is worth noting, though, that maternal immunoglobulins cross the placenta to enter fetal blood. Fetal hemoglobin is a large protein and, thus, cannot easily cross the placenta.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Myelin is a white lipid-containing material surrounding the axons of many neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is arranged on the axon discontinuously; the gaps between the segments of myelin are called nodes of Ranvier, eliminating (B). Myelin increases the conduction velocity by insulating segments of the axon so that the membrane is permeable to ions only at the nodes of Ranvier, eliminating (A). The action potential jumps from node to node, a process known as saltatory conduction, eliminating (D). Action potentials are often described as being \u201call-or-nothing\u201d; the magnitude of the potential difference of an action potential is fixed, regardless of the intensity of the stimulus. Thus, myelin does not affect the magnitude of the potential difference in an action potential, making (C) the correct answer."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "First, consider the function of voltage-gated calcium channels. When the nerve terminal depolarizes, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing for influx of calcium. This influx of calcium triggers fusion of the synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters with the membrane of the neuron at the nerve terminal. This allows for exocytosis of the neurotransmitters into the synapse. If a disease blocked the influx of calcium, there would be no release of neurotransmitters. A lack of neurotransmitters means that the neuron cannot send excitatory signals. Thus, any symptoms resulting from this disease would be due to an inability of neurons to transmit excitatory signals to the muscle. If neurons cannot communicate, flaccid paralysis may be one of the results."

      "explanation": "The question stem indicates that the newly discovered hormone functions as a first messenger, stimulating the conversion of ATP to cAMP; cAMP functions as a second messenger, triggering a signaling cascade in the cell. Hormones that act via second messengers and are relatively large in size (short peptides or complex polypeptides) are peptide hormones. This hormone could be a tropic hormone, but it is also entirely possible for it to be a direct hormone; thus, (D) can be eliminated."

While other therapies are more frequently used to treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels), such as calcium gluconate or calcium chloride, administration of parathyroid hormone would also raise blood calcium concentration.

In a genotypic female, this indicates that the infant was exposed to androgens during the fetal period. In addition, the infant is also losing sodium, causing hyponatremia.

During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, while the external intercostal muscles contract, pulling the rib cage up and out. These actions cause an overall increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. During exhalation, both the diaphragm and the external intercostals relax, causing a decrease in the volume of the thoracic cavity because of the recoil of these tissues.

While you are not expected to know ventilator settings for the MCAT, you should be able to decode what this phrase means: at the end of expiration, the ventilator will provide a higher pressure than normal, which forces extra air into the alveoli. This pressure must be used to prevent alveolar collapse, which should remind you that surfactant serves the same purpose by reducing surface tension.

      "explanation": "According to the Bohr effect, decreasing the pH in the blood decreases hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for O2. This makes (C) the correct answer. The affinity is generally lowered in exercising muscle to facilitate unloading of oxygen to tissues, eliminating (A). A decrease in the PaCO2 would cause a decrease in [H+] or increased pH\u2014which increases hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for O2, eliminating (B). Finally, (D) is incorrect because hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for O2 is higher in fetal blood than in adult blood."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The exchange of fluid is greatly influenced by the differences in the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of blood and tissues. The osmotic (oncotic) pressure remains relatively constant; however, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end is greater than the hydrostatic pressure at the venous end. As a result, fluid moves out of the capillaries at the arterial end and back in at the venous end. Fluid is reabsorbed at the venous end because the osmotic pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure. Proteins should not cross the capillary wall under normal circumstances."

(A) is incorrect because arteries are thick-walled and veins are thin-walled. (B) is also incorrect; this relationship is reversed in pulmonary and umbilical circulation.

If the bile duct were occluded, as in (A), then bile would not be able to flow into the digestive tract and would build up, increasing bilirubin levels in the blood. If many red blood cells were lysed, as in (B), then bilirubin levels would rise in accordance with the increased hemoglobin release. If liver failure occurred, as in (D), then the liver would be unable to produce bile, and bilirubin would again build up.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus functions as a thermostat that regulates body temperature. When it\u2019s cold outside, nervous stimulation to the blood vessels in the skin is increased, causing the vessels to constrict. This constriction diminishes blood flow to the skin surface and prevents heat loss. Sweat glands are turned off to prevent heat loss through evaporation. Skeletal muscles are stimulated to shiver (rapidly contract), which increases the metabolic rate and produces heat. The hypothalamus is also involved in other processes, including the release of endocrine hormones, regulation of appetite, and circadian rhythms."

      "explanation": "The kidneys function to eliminate wastes such as urea, while reabsorbing various important substances such as glucose and amino acids for reuse by the body. Generation of a solute concentration gradient from the cortex to the medulla allows a considerable amount of water to be reabsorbed. Excretion of concentrated urine serves to limit water losses from the body and helps to preserve blood volume. Thus, the primary function of the nephron is to create urine that is hypertonic to the blood, making (A) the correct answer and eliminating (B) and (D).

      "explanation": "The glomerulus is the most likely location of pathology if large proteins are detected in the urine. This is because large proteins should not be able to pass through the filter of the glomerulus in the first place. Once large proteins are in the filtrate, no other nephron structure can reabsorb them. Thus, the only likely source of protein in the urine is glomerular pathology."

Because there is a correlation between the frequency of recombination and the distance between genes on a chromosome, if we are given the frequencies, we can determine gene order. Remember that one map unit equals 1 percent recombination frequency. The easiest way to begin is to determine the two genes that are farthest apart; in this case, N and O recombine with a frequency of 18%, so they are 18 map units apart on the chromosome: N and P recombine with 1% frequency, and P and O recombine with 17% frequency, so P must be between N and O: N \u2194 1 % P \u2194 17 % O Finally, M and P recombine with 5% frequency, and M and O recombine with 12% frequency, so M must be between P and O: N \u2194 1 % P \u2194 5 % M \u2194 12 % O"

When an organism of unknown genotype is crossed against one with straight, brown hair, the phenotypic ratio is as follows:  What is the genotype of the unknown parent?\nI. 25% curly black hair\nII. 25% straight black hair\nIII. 25% curly brown hair\nIV. 25% straight brown hair",

      "explanation": "In this dihybrid problem, a doubly recessive individual is crossed with an individual of unknown genotype; this is known as a test cross. The straight- and brown-haired organism has the genotype bbcc and can thus only produce gametes carrying bc. Looking at the F1 offspring, there is a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. The fact that both the dominant and recessive traits are present in the offspring means that the unknown parental genotype must contain both dominant and recessive alleles for each trait. The unknown parental genotype must therefore be BbCc. If you want to double-check the answer, you can work out the Punnett square for the cross BbCc \u00d7 bbcc:"
