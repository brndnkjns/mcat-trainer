      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The average force on the rocket equals its mass times the average acceleration; the average acceleration equals the change in velocity divided by the time over which the change occurs. So, the change in velocity equals the average force times the time divided by the mass: F=ma\u2192a=Fma=\u0394v\u0394t\u2192\u0394v=a\u0394t=F\u0394tm=(20\u00d7103 N)(8 s)1000 kg=160 ms (B) represents the new velocity of the rocket, not its change in velocity.

      "question_text": "An elevator is designed to carry a maximum weight of 9800 N (including its own weight), and to move upward at a speed of 5 ms after an initial period of acceleration. What is the relationship between the maximum tension in the elevator cable and the maximum weight of the elevator while the elevator is accelerating upward?",

        "D": "It cannot be determined from the information given."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The forces on the elevator are the tension upward and the weight downward, so the net force on the elevator is the difference between the two. For the elevator to accelerate upwards, the tension in the cable will have to be greater than the maximum weight so that there is a net force directed upwards."

        "D": "Right before the firefighter lands on the ground"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The firefighter\u2019s acceleration is always directed downward, whereas the firefighter\u2019s velocity starts out horizontal and gradually rotates downwards as the downward velocity increases. Therefore, as time progresses, the angle between the velocity and acceleration decreases, which means that the maximum angle occurs at the instant the firefighter jumps."

        "D": "98 N"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The static force of friction acts parallel to the plane and is in the opposite direction from the parallel component of gravity in this setup. Because the wagon is in equilibrium, these two forces are equal in magnitude. Remember that gravity is often split into components in inclined plane problems. Rather than splitting into x- and y-components, however, it is more convenient to split the gravity vector into parallel and perpendicular components. The parallel component of gravity is given by the expression mg sin \u03b8. Plugging in the values from the question, both the parallel component of gravity and static force of friction must be equal to (10 kg)(9.8ms2) (sin 30\u00b0) = 49 N."

To find the direction of the resultant vector, use the right hand rule. The thumb of the right hand points in the direction of vector A, the fingers point in the direction of vector B, and the palm reveals the direction of the vector product. In this problem, the right hand rule indicates that the direction of the resulting vector is out of the page, consistent with (D). Note that since the cross product always produces another vector, choices (A) and (B) can be immediately eliminated.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In order for the seesaw to be balanced, the torque due to the child (\u03c4c) must be exactly counteracted by the torque due to the parent (\u03c4p).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The maximum height depends only on the y-component of the velocity, so the horizontal distance can be ignored. The initial y-velocity can be calculated by: vf = 12\u2219sin(30o) = 6 m/s. To solve for max height, use the equation: vf2 = vi2 + 2ax, where, at the maximum height, the vertical velocity is equal to 0 m/s. Plugging in values yields the equation 0 = 36 - 20x. Solving for x gives x = 1.8 m, matching (B)."

        "D": "the rock and ball will collide in the air before reaching the ground."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "We only need to analyze the motion in the vertical dimension to answer this question. If both the rock and ball began with no vertical velocity, they would reach the ground at the same time. However, because the rock begins with an upward component of velocity, it will take time to reach a maximum height before falling back toward the ground. Functionally, the rock\u2019s free fall thus starts higher and later than the ball\u2019s. The rock will necessarily hit the ground after the ball."

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Because the question stem indicates that centrifugal force is reactionary and acts outwardly away from the center of rotation, we can draw the conclusion that it is a reaction to the centripetal force.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The presence of friction does not change the impact of Newton\u2019s laws. A net force must still be applied to cause motion. This net force is not necessarily equal to an applied force, as friction and gravity also act on the object; thus, statement I is eliminated. Static friction opposes the movement of stationary objects, and is necessarily greater than the force of kinetic friction; thus, statement II is correct. Statement III is false because the normal force is related to mass, and friction is related to the normal force."

      "explanation": "Because the weight of the barbell (force acting downward) is mg=275 kg\u00d710 ms2, or about 2750 N, it follows that the weightlifter must exert an equal and opposite force of 2750 N on the barbell. The work done in lifting the barbell is therefore W = Fd cos \u03b8 = (2750 N)(2.4 m)(cos 0) \u2248 7000 J. Using the same equation, it follows that the work done to hold the barbell in place is W = Fd cos \u03b8 = (2750 N)(0 m)(cos \u03b8) = 0 J. Because the barbell is held in place and there is no displacement, the work done is zero. This is closest to (C)."

The heat required to raise the temperature of the earrings from 25\u00b0C to 1064\u00b0C is q=mc\u0394T=(0.5 kg)(126 Jkg \u22c5 K)(1039 K)\u224860\u00d71000=60 kJ Thus, it takes about 60 kJ of heat to bring the earrings to their melting point. The next step is to calculate how much heat is needed to melt the earrings. For this, use the heat of fusion (the latent heat) of gold: q=mL=(0.5 kg)(6.37\u00d7104 Jkg)=32 kJ So overall, it requires approximately 60 + 32 = 92 kJ of heat to melt the gold earrings.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Saying that substance B has a higher internal energy cannot explain the phenomenon because the internal energy is irrelevant; the heat involved in the process is related only to the specific heat, the heat of fusion, and the heat of vaporization. All of the other choices could explain the phenomenon. The heat required to melt the solid is determined by the heat of fusion, (C). The heat required to bring the liquid to its boiling point is determined by the specific heat, (A). The heat required to boil the liquid is determined by the heat of vaporization, (B)."

      "options": {
        "A": "positive in experiment A and negative in experiment B.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "When the ink randomly intersperses throughout the water, the final state is more disordered than the initial state, so the entropy change of the system is positive. When the oil separates from the water, the final state is just as ordered as the initial state (because the oil and the water are still completely separate), so the entropy change is zero. You can also answer this question by noticing the reversibility of the two experiments. Experiment A has a positive entropy change because it is irreversible, while experiment B has no entropy change because the reaction is reversible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the overall entropy change of a system and its surroundings can never be negative in a thermodynamic process that moves from one equilibrium state to another."

During the phase change, the temperature will remain constant. Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules in a sample, so a change in kinetic energy, (A), is essentially the same thing as a change in temperature. The heat transfer by radiation described in (B) will definitely change the temperature of the solid as long as it is not in the process of melting. (D) Describes heat transfer by convection, in which the warm gas will transfer heat to the cold gas until they both reach an intermediate temperature."

      "explanation": "The tension in the chain is the difference between the anchor\u2019s weight and the buoyant force because the object is in translational equilibrium: T = Fg \u2013 Fbuoy. The object\u2019s weight is 833 N, and the buoyant force can be found using Archimedes\u2019 principle. The magnitude of the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the seawater that the anchor displaces: Fbuoy = \u03c1wVwg Because the anchor is submerged entirely, the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the anchor, which is equal to its mass divided by its density (VA=mA\u03c1A). We are not given the anchor\u2019s mass, but its value must be the magnitude of the weight of the anchor divided by g. Putting all of this together, we can obtain the buoyant force: Fbuoy=\u03c1wVwg=\u03c1wVAg=\u03c1w(mA\u03c1A)g=\u03c1w(Fg\u03c1Ag)g=Fg(\u03c1w\u03c1A)=833 N(1025 kgm37800 kgm3)\u2248100 N(actual=109 N) Lastly, we can obtain the tension from the initial equation T = Fg \u2013 Fbuoy: T = 833 N \u2212 109 N = 724 N The key to quickly solving this problem on Test Day is recognizing that the answer choices contain an outlier (A), a value slightly less than the weight of the anchor (B), the weight of the anchor (C), and a value slightly higher than the weight of the anchor (D). Since buoyant force is in the same direction as tension and their sum must equal the weight of the anchor, (B) is the most likely answer."

      "explanation": "It is known that water flows faster through a narrower pipe. The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the pipe because the same volume of water must pass by each point at each time interval. Let A be the 0.15 m pipe and B the 0.20 m pipe, and use the continuity equation: \u03bdAAA = \u03bdBAB where \u03bd is the speed and A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. Because \u03bd is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, and the area is proportional to the square of the diameter A=\u03c0r2=\u03c0d24, we obtain the following: vB=vA(\u03c0dA24)(\u03c0dB24)=vA(dAdB)2vB=(8)(0.150.20)2=(8)(34)2vB=(8)(916)=92=4.5ms"

      "explanation": "This question tests our understanding of Pascal\u2019s principle, which states that a change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of the containing vessel. We are told that the work required to lift the bed with the patient is double the work needed to lift just the bed. In other words, the force required doubles when both the bed and the patient have to be lifted. To maintain the same pressure, we must double the cross-sectional area of the platform of the hydraulic lever on which the patient and the bed are lifted."

      "explanation": "It is not necessary to do any calculations to answer this question. The open vertical pipes are exposed to the same atmospheric pressure; therefore, differences in the heights of the columns of water in the vertical pipes are dependent only on the differences in hydrostatic pressures in the horizontal pipe. Because the horizontal pipe has variable cross-sectional area, water will flow the fastest and the hydrostatic pressure will have its lowest value where the horizontal pipe is narrowest; this is called the Venturi effect.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The continuity equation states that the flow rate of a fluid must remain constant from one cross-section to another. In other words, when an ideal fluid flows from a pipe with a large cross-sectional area to one that is narrower, its speed increases. This can be illustrated through the equation A1\u03bd1 = A2\u03bd2. If blood flows much more slowly through the capillaries, we can infer that the cross-sectional area is larger. This might seem surprising at first glance, but given that each blood vessel divides into thousands of little capillaries, it is not hard to imagine that adding the cross-sectional areas of each capillary from an entire capillary bed results in an area that is larger than the cross-sectional area of the aorta."

      "explanation": "An electric field\u2019s direction at a given point is defined as the direction of the force that would be exerted on a positive test charge in that position. Because electrons are negatively charged particles, they will therefore feel a force in the opposite direction of the electric field\u2019s vector. In this case, because the force points to the left (toward R), an electron will feel a force pointing to the right (toward S) if E is in the same direction as F."

Therefore, because the vector direction is the same, we can just focus on the magnitudes of the two magnetic fields. We know that B1 = 10 T at a distance r. Consider the relationships in the equation B=\u03bc0I2\u03c0r. Magnetic field and current are directly proportional, whereas magnetic field and distance are inversely proportional.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Often, with potential energy, it can be easier to think in terms of common sense, rather than in terms of rigorous mathematical formulas: opposite charges attract. When oppositely charged species like ATP and a cation are moved apart, their potential energy will increase, reflecting the fact that these oppositely charged species would like to move back to a closer distance. Furthermore, the formula for electric potential energy is U = kQq/r. From this formula, observe that the relationship between U and r is given by U \u221d 1/r, meaning that if r is changed by a factor of 2, then U will also change by a factor of 2, and not by a factor of 4. These observations together are enough to justify (A) as the correct answer. For a more mathematically rigorous explanation, consider that the opposite charges of ATP and the cation will cause the output of the formula U = kQq/r to be negative. Then, when the distance between these two charges is doubled, this expression becomes U = kQq/2r, which is half as large in magnitude. However, because U is negative for oppositely charged species, a smaller negative value actually means that U has increased! (Consider: though the magnitude is smaller, a temperature of -5oC is actually warmer than a temperature of -25oC. Similarly, a U with a smaller negative magnitude actually means higher energy.) In short, doubling the radius means that the energy is also doubled when the charged species have opposite charges."

The voltage across the terminals of the battery when there is no current flowing is referred to as the electromotive force (emf or \u03b5 of the battery). However, when a current is flowing through the circuit, the voltage across the terminals of the battery is decreased by an amount equal to the current multiplied by the internal resistance of the battery. Mathematically, this is given by the equation V = \u03b5 \u2013 irint To determine the emf of the battery, first calculate the voltage across the battery when the current is flowing. For this, we can use Ohm\u2019s law: V=IR=(0.5 A)(3 \u03a9)=1.5 V Because we know the internal resistance of the battery, the current, and the voltage, we can calculate the emf: \u03b5=V+irint=1.5 V+(0.5 A)(0.1 \u03a9)=1.5+0.05=1.55 V The answer makes sense in the context of a real battery because its internal resistance is supposed to be very small so that the voltage provided to the circuit is as close as possible to the emf of the cell when there is no current running."

For the resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is 1Rp = 12 \u03a9+32 \u03a9\u2192Rp =12\u03a9 The total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the remaining resistor and the equivalent resistance of the other two: Rs = 12\u03a9+12\u03a9 = 1 \u03a9 Now that we know the equivalent resistance, we can calculate the total current using Ohm\u2019s law: I=VR=10 V1 \u03a9=10 A Finally, we can determine the voltage drop across the parallel resistors. The voltage drop across the 12\u03a9 resistor must be (10 A)(12 \u03a9)=5 V. Therefore, there must be a 5 V drop across both the 23 \u03a9 resistor and 2 \u2126 resistor, according to Kirchhoff\u2019s loop rule. Each of these resistors forms a complete loop in combination with the 12 \u03a9 resistor and 10 V voltage source, and the net potential difference around any closed loop must be 0 V.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "If these two glasses are perfectly identical, then the fact that the first glass shattered at 808 Hz tells us that this is very close (if not identical) to the natural (resonant) frequency of the glass. If the singer produces a frequency that is not equal (or very close) to the natural frequency, then the applied frequency will not cause the glass to resonate, and there will not be the increase in wave amplitude associated with resonating objects. Attenuation will increase with increased frequency because there is more motion over which nonconservative forces can damp the sound wave; however, even if sound level was matched to that which shattered the first glass when accounting for attenuation, the glass would still not shatter for the reasons described above, eliminating (D)."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This question is testing our understanding of pipes open at one or both ends. To begin, remember that high-frequency sounds have a high pitch and low-frequency sounds have a low pitch. The pipe in this example begins as one that is open on both ends, and then one end is closed off. Our task, therefore, is to determine how the frequency of the second harmonic differs between a pipe that is open at both ends from one of equal length that is open at only one end. For a pipe of length L open at both ends, the wavelength for the second harmonic (first overtone) is equal to L: \u03bb=2Ln=2L2=L In contrast, for a pipe open at one end and closed at the other, the wavelength is equal to 4L3: Keep in mind that the first overtone for a closed pipe corresponds to the third harmonic, not the second. Thus, when the sibling covers one end of the flute, the wavelength increases. Given that the wavelength and the frequency of a sound are inversely proportional, an increase in wavelength corresponds to a decrease in frequency. Therefore, when the sibling covers one end of the flute, the sound produced by the instrument will be slightly lower in pitch than the original sound."

This occurs maximally when an object is traveling at exactly the same speed as the wave is traveling (the speed of sound). Once an object moves faster than the speed of sound, some of the effects of the shock wave are mitigated because all of the wave fronts will trail behind the object, destructively interfering with each other."

The applicable version of the Doppler effect equation is f\u2032=f(\u03bd+\u03bdD)v where \u03bd is the speed of the sound. Because the numerator is greater than the denominator, f\u2032 will be greater than f; therefore, statement I is true. The scenario described in statement II will produce a similar, but not identical, frequency for the teacher: the frequency formula would be f\u2032=fv(v\u2212vS). The apparent frequency will increase, but the increase will not be exactly the same as if the teacher had been moving.

The first part, however, is straightforward because the frequency of a light ray traveling from one medium to another does not change. Because the frequency must be 5 \u00d7 1014 Hz, we can eliminate (C) and (D). For the angle of refraction, we can either calculate it or determine it using logic. First, the light ray goes from air into crystal; that is, from a low index of refraction to a higher one. According to Snell\u2019s law, the angle of refraction will be smaller than the incident angle (closer to the normal). When the light ray moves from crystal to chromium, it again goes from a lower index of refraction into a higher one, thus making the angle of refraction even smaller, eliminating (B).

As the slit becomes narrower, the central maximum (the brightest and most central fringe) becomes wider. This can also be seen in the equation for the position of dark fringes in a slit\u2013lens setup (a sin \u03b8 = n\u03bb).

Calculating 18 x 7 = 126 and 22 x 9 = 198 for the decimal values is more manageable than the exact numbers and the spacing of the answer choices allows for our estimation. The binding energy can then be determined from this mass defect: E=mc2=0.4096 amu\u00d7932MeVamu\u22480.4\u00d7900=360 MeV The closest answer is (C)."

To convert mass into energy, we are told that 1 amu can be converted into 932 MeV of energy. All we need to do now is calculate how much mass, in amu, is converted in the reaction. Because we are given the atomic mass for each of the elements in the reaction, this is simply a matter of balancing the equation: mass defect=(1.0087 amu+10.0129 amu) \u2013(7.0160 amu+4.0026 amu)=11.0216\u221211.0186=0.0030 amu Given both the small magnitude of this value and the small difference of the answer choices, it is best to not round at this point of the calculation. This is the amount of mass that has been converted into energy. To obtain energy from mass, we have to multiply by the conversion factor (1 amu = 932 MeV): E = 0.003 \u00d7 932 \u2248 0.003 \u00d7 900 = 2.7 MeV At this point we were able to round for an easier calculation that keeps us very near the correct answer choice."

All of these methods (with the exception of venipuncture, (C)) measure oxygen saturation. According to the principle of beneficence, we must minimize potential harms associated with our investigations; thus, the noninvasive pulse oximeter should be greatly favored over other measurements for an initial assessment."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Because the error is in data transfer, the original source of data can be consulted to allow for the inclusion of the correct data point. An error in instrument calibration may introduce bias; while this should not affect the standard deviation of a sample, it would certainly affect the mean. The instrument would have to be recalibrated, and the relevant data points would have to be measured again to correct for this type of outlier, eliminating choice (B). A skewed distribution is one that has a long tail. In this case, it may be more challenging to determine if a particular value is an outlier or simply a value in the long tail of the distribution. Repeated sampling or a large sample size is usually required to determine if a sample is truly skewed, eliminating choice (C). An anomalous result is challenging to interpret, and how to correct for the result may be unclear. In some cases, the result should be inflated or weighted more heavily to reflect its significance; in other cases, it should be interpreted as a regular value. In still other cases, it is appropriate to drop the anomalous result. This decision should ideally be made before the study even begins, but this still certainly requires more consideration than simply checking a result from one\u2019s original data set, eliminating choice (D) and making choice (A) correct."
